1jgwks5,crispins_crispian,2025-03-22 00:57:55,9206,"Millennials have the biggest photographic black hole in modern history I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot lately. We (millennials) have the largest gap in personal photographic records of any generation in the modern age. Not because we didn‚Äôt take photos but because we lost them.

We lived through that weird in-between era:
- Too late for shoeboxes full of printed Kodak photos
- Too early for iCloud, Google Photos to back everything up
- Right in the middle of MySpace, Photobucket, Friendster, and early Facebook‚Äîwith no one thinking to archive anything

I‚Äôm talking about:
-Crappy digital cameras with SD cards that vanished in a move
- Old flip phones and Razrs with tiny, pixelated videos of high school parties
- College photos that lived only on a laptop that died in 2011
- Entire friendships and phases of our lives lost with the deletion of a MySpace account

We documented everything, but most of it is gone. Billions of photos, probably. Compare that to Gen Z, who has their whole life in Google Drive or their Snapchat Memories. Or Gen X, who have physical photo albums passed down.

It‚Äôs like we lived in the lost city of Atlantis, and no one preserved the artifacts.

Anyone else feel this loss?

1jgwnc7,SarcastiKatt,2025-03-22 01:01:13,10749,"iMark‚Äôs decision made complete sense I see a lot of people arguing that iMark‚Äôs decision doesn‚Äôt make sense, but I disagree. 

He has always been an innie and treated accordingly - he‚Äôs been constantly used, told what to do, lied to, and manipulated. He doesn‚Äôt know who to trust or what to think. oMark has proven to him he‚Äôs selfish with no regard or care for iMark (‚ÄúHeleny‚Äù), he doesn‚Äôt trust Cobel (for obvious reasons), and his outie‚Äôs sister only cares about his outie (‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù in response to iMark asking what would happen to all the innies). 

What changed his mind to help Gemma was two-fold in my opinion. 1) Knowing she was an innie - 25 times - and that he himself was doing this to her.  2) Helly - someone he loves and trusts - laying out all the reasons he should. 

So he‚Äôs willing to help Gemma, but it‚Äôs not for oMark, and he certainly doesn‚Äôt have feelings for her. Waking up mid-kiss on the elevator reinforced this, which was reinforced even more when she went into the stairwell. He has this woman he has no feelings for frantically begging for him to come with her. 

Then he hears Helly call his name and turns to see the only woman he has ever loved. So he‚Äôs looking back and forth and his decision becomes:

OPTION 1: Go through the door, and likely cease to exist while his outie (who he doesn‚Äôt like or trust) is happy, but never know what happens to Helly 

OPTION 2: Stay alive, with Helly, for even 10 more minutes

For iMark, he already saved his outie‚Äôs wife. He already did the noble thing, as he always has done. Now he wants to do something for him. Maybe the last thing for himself he‚Äôll ever be able to do.

1jgka4t,Eman21701,2025-03-21 16:01:44,22399,"My boss decided to take 10% of all card tips and give it to our manager‚Ä¶ For context, I work at 2 different food truck businesses (called 1 and 2 in the photos).
T is my boss and L is our new manager, J is our old manager.

My other coworker and I just found out that our boss takes 10% of all card tips and gives them to our manager EVEN WHEN THEY AREN‚ÄôT clocked in and apparently has been doing so at least since I‚Äôve been here the last 4 years. I feel justified in saying all of this as I am their longest lasting employee, and am only not working more due to school.

My coworker and I worked pretty much an all day event on the 15th. We were clocked in to food truck 2. Our manager L was also clocked in to food truck 2 but working on food truck 1 (separate business) training a new employee

Well, on our square reader on the truck it showed us making about $75 just in tips. Come to find out, we noticed that the both of ours combined only added up to about $50. To which we realized L was also clocked in to food truck 2 with us and not even working the same job or even the same truck as us. Therefore, stealing our tips whether it be intentional or not. L said she messaged our boss but my coworker and I had our doubts so I messaged our boss anyways. Hence, the pictures. My coworker and I were acting all nice in the pictures, but man.. we were talking with a couple other employees and we all think it‚Äôs total crap and not fair.

Needless to say, I‚Äôm a little fed up. We don‚Äôt have any full-time employees besides L, and the other 3 employees we have (4 including myself) are all in college a.k.a. we‚Äôre broke haha. So not only does our manager who works full-time getting almost 40+ hours a week makes more than us, but they‚Äôre getting our tips too. My other coworkers and I have no idea why our boss is so head over heels for L. L doesn‚Äôt do much except barely do the job correctly. We‚Äôre convinced the only reason L is manager is because L isn‚Äôt currently in school and needs a job. If this is ‚Äúas of March 1st‚Äù why did you say our old manager J got 10% of our tips as well?

I get that I‚Äôm basically bitching about Pennies here.. but for someone as broke as a college student, every penny counts. Maybe I‚Äôm just greedy/salty. Just frustrating nonetheless.

1jh1c7i,Sett_Haymaker,2025-03-22 05:22:08,706,"Update on Zeus and T1 This post is about the video uploaded in Korean channel GÏãùÎ∞±Í≥º, which is the largest channel in Korea when it comes to handling issues in game industry, and the article uploaded on Inven, a Korean gaming news platform. 

The Agency claimed that the moment this issue started, they requested Korean eSports Fair Committee to correct the spread of false information, but there was no response even until now, so they came to this channel at last. Agency sent all the chat history between them and T1 to this along with timelines, which only some could be shared within the video/article due to confidentiality clause. The channel then requested T1 for an interview to verify all the things Agency said. T1 replied that they will reply back after considerations, but there was no further reply for the past 3 weeks. With this background knowledge, this is the timeline of events:

2024 November 7th, 12 days before the end of contract  
Becker Jung, T1's manager of league of legend team had a meeting with Zeus, and they both agreed that they wanted to re-sign, then left.

2024 November 12nd, D-7  
First actual negotiation began. Zeus was offered ""disrespected"" and ""unacceptable"" level of salary. T1's excuse was that the Esports industry had a poor financial structure, so Agency replied that they will wait for market evaluation to see whether other teams are having the same problem.

2024 November 15th, D-4  
Second negotiation, but did not reach agree point.

2024 November 16th, D-3  
Third negotiation, T1 offered slightly increased salary compared to the first offer, but was nothing big enough to change the opinion of Zeus and Agency.

2024 November 18th, D-1  
Another slight increase, another disagreement.

2024 November 19th, 9:00  
The contract of Zeus ended. Other teams including foreign teams started to offer. Many foreign teams made huge offers but Zeus wanted to stay within LCK so was declined.

2024 November 19th, 11:44  
The Agency made the first offer to T1 after the market evaluation.

2024 November 19th, 13:32  
T1 makes the final offer to the Agency

2024 November 19th, 13:48  
Becker Jung told Agency that T1 was running out of patience, Agency considered this as a sign that T1 was not willing to negotiate any further and rejected the final offer.

2024 November 19th, 13:50  
T1 requested for direct call with Zeus, Agency agrees. Zeus told T1 that if there isn't huge difference in salary with other teams, He will sign T1. 

2024 November 19th, 14:14  
T1 requested face to face meeting with Zeus and departed from T1 building in Gangnam to Songdo, Incheon. However, Agency noticed T1 that the contract must be complete before 15:00 due to Deadline with HLE. FYI, it usually take about one and a half hour from T1 building to Songdo due to traffic. Hence, Agency told T1 that if they got any better offer, just offer them via phone.

2024 November 19th, 14:43  
Agency reminds T1 for the last time that they are willing to take offers via phone.

2024 November 19th, 15:00  
The deadline of HLE contract. However, Agency push the deadline back a bit for the actual final offer from T1

2024 November 19th, 15:10  
T1 made the final offer. 

2024 November 19th, 15:20  
Agency makes the final offer back to T1, with same salary but different contract duration

2024 November 19th, 15:30  
T1 rejects the change in contract duration and offers with different condition. Agency rejected the final offer. Zeus notices T1 that he will be signing with HLE through Agency. 

2024 November 19th, 15:40  
Zeus signs the contract with HLE

2024 November 19th, 16:00  
T1 arrived to Songdo, Incheon and met with Zeus. The contract was complete so they said their farewells.

2024 November 19th, 23:31  
T1 announce the contract with Doran.

There was a claim that Agency sold Zeus to HLE just to get more contract fee, but the contract between Zeus and Agency was that the contract fee Agency receives is 0%, as Agency thought that re-signing with T1 was a guarantee so there would be nothing much to do. Hence, instead of trying to receive contract fee, they wanted to use Zeus for their marketing and attracting sponsorships.

This was all based on the evidence provided by the agency and T1 did not responded to it yet so there might be some false information. However, it does seem more likely that these are true as false evidence would cause even bigger trouble than tempering for the Agency.

Now they charge admittance fees, have live music, tractor rides, photo ops, etc. Its just a farm it doesn't need to be Disney land.

Also, the way it was made is absolutely stunning. Stop motion is awesome, sad that its not used a lot nowadays. 

Im not going to spoil much here, and Im going to say to go watch it yourself. Amazing movie. 

Its about a Fox and his family getting into a conflict with three ""corporate"" food giants, that eventually evolves into a full blown war between the two, and even drags other animals into the conflict. 

There are also some elements of philosophy too, so yeah. 

All in all its a solid 8.5/10. The only bad thing was that its short, but then again its based on the book, so yeah. Go read that too if you would like.",/r/movies/comments/1jgs1in/fantastic_mr_fox_is_one_of_the_best_movies_ive/

The photos were taken by my friend @elifeyson on Instagram, who is an amazing cosplayer and kindly helped me capture these shots. I also had the support of my dad throughout the process.

This Moon Knight cosplay is a mix of crafted and heavily modified pieces. The armor parts are made from PVC, the chest moon was detailed with a pyrographer for the engraved texture, the mask and crescent moons were 3D printed, all the gold details were hand-painted with a chrome effect and then assembled with the bandages, and the cape features hand-painted symbols. The base clothing (except the cape, which is completely handmade), was bought but fully customized by ourselves and altered to fit the design.

It was a huge project full of learning, patience, and effort. Hope you like it as much as I enjoyed making it!

She hasn't thought this all the way through. Quebec is, today, saying, they're open to a pipeline but it has to be socialized properly. She's threatening that the PM has to OVERRIDE their sovereign rights and grant unfettered access. She will blow this negotiation that is potentially laying at her feet because she's too busy sucking up to Donald Trump and the West Palm Beach set and his cronies like Ben Shapiro to actually give a shit about Canada.

This is a national EMERGENCY. The Prime Minister is saying he supports conventional and clean energy. Tonight he mused about which pipeline would have the most priority (Quebec, incidentally so they could get off US oil which is the right answer). She's having a peeing contest about emissions caps. She is SERIOUSLY going to blow this.

How much do you think the 14 CEO's that signed onto that letter to the leaders of the major parties need her, at this moment, to be threatening separation on top of a TARIFF WAR. That's just what their shareholders want is more UNCERTAINTY and INSTABILITY. She wants to see capital flight to the US, yes, any whiff of an Alberta separation will send that capital down south, irrespective of the Wexit goons that think this is what Albertans want. WE DO NOT.  AND YES, I'M YELLING.

We have an opportunity here to deliver energy to the East and she's going to shoot herself in the foot by being such a beotch. Anything to own the Libs though I guess.

PS if you don't think she isn't trying to undermine Mark Carney, read this:

I talked to my husband after he got home today and long story short, they have feelings for one another.

He denied cheating but I feel like there was at least emotional cheating. I don‚Äôt know what to do as I‚Äôve been with him since I was 16 and he was my first everything, I can‚Äôt even imagine a life without him.

I‚Äôm currently at my mom‚Äôs house. I came over here after all the chaos, he‚Äôs been blowing up my phone with text and calls. First he was apologetic, to it was ‚Äúshe means nothing and now I‚Äôm insecure woman he claims.

He tells me he still loves me but if I‚Äôm with you then I want to be the only one you love. Lots of you also pointed out that he was disrespectful which he was and I can‚Äôt stand for that either. 

I checked the ring camera and her car is currently in our driveway. Anyways, I feel like complete shit. Me and him mostly have mutual friends since I didn‚Äôt have much friends in high school, just college which is where I met him (we were in the same friend group). I‚Äôve been crying and I‚Äôll admit embarrassingly I‚Äôve thrown up about twice. My mom has been super supportive and tonight she‚Äôs letting me forget with ice cream and rewatching love island. But she said it‚Äôll be temporary as me and her need to have discussions on what will be with me and my husband going forward.

That‚Äôs it though, thanks for all the advice I got and completely things get better. 

Again, I‚Äôm sorry if any of this is hard to understand as my hands are very shaky.

I‚Äôm so tired of seeing ‚ÄúI only work 3 hours‚Äù, ‚ÄúMouse jiggler saved my life‚Äù, ‚Äúhow do I work 2 WFH jobs‚Äù, ‚ÄúI do nothing‚Äù type of posts.

WE GET IT. However, I‚Äôd like to think the vast majority of us ACTUALLY take WFH as a privilege that we‚Äôre willing to work for. I purposely work long hours JUST to prove my effectiveness from home. 

I could 200% get away with watching movies, playing games, etc. but I choose not to. Why? Bc I realize I need my job more than they need me (everyone is in the same boat, admit it or not) and WFH is the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.

With all of the RTO stuff going on, PLEASE stop posting all over social media how you do nothing and get away with it. Those of us that actually value the perk of wfh and our jobs don‚Äôt deserve to lose the privilege just bc you can‚Äôt wait to brag on social media about having no workplace morals.

If you do nothing? Cool. Keep doing that. Idc‚Ä¶But you posting about it only worsens even your own case and future. 

Is one Reddit post going to ruin the future of WFH? Of course not, however, 1000+ of them can change sentiment. Reddit pretty frequently results in high SEO rankings/ google ai responses. Executives can see this stuff, even without Reddit. So please for ALL of us (including yourselves) just stop and go play your games or watch your movies or whatever. 

You‚Äôre the loud few rather than the state of WFH as a whole, where most of us actually work. Thank you for attending my ted talk.",/r/WFH/comments/1jgy3qk/psa_if_you_dont_work_a_full_8_hours_a_day_keep_it/

One I could not fix due to legal regulations. I explained this, and they said they needed the matter escalated to my superior, and they were considering taking legal action if it wasn't addressed properly. (sorry, keeping it intentionally vague to ensure privacy & prevent repercussions for me)

I talked to my manager while the employee was on hold, they said they couldn't take the call right then, but to escalate it to them via the email thread this employee had also started. I explained this to the employee, they seemed reasonably happy, and I sent the email to my manager immediately after getting off the phone. 

A week later, my manager responds to the email thread with the employee included, @'s me and says they'll have me handle this from here. They never sent any other email. They never did anything to help. Just waited a week after it was escalated to them and then immediately sent it back to me. I responded to the email, without the employee included, and explained the situation again, reminding them why they said they would be handling it. They told me that this was in my job description and I had to handle this, as they didn't have time. They also said they never agreed to handle it. 

So, I handled it. I explained there was nothing we could do, again, and that I couldn't provide them with any further assistance or escalate the case. A few weeks later we get a lawsuit. Guess who finally steps in to handle the situation? Too late, the CPO and President were already involved, and I was able to provide the supporting documentation showing my supervisor refused to take over & prevent a potential lawsuit. They didn't fire her but she was removed from a supervisory position, so I call it a win.

1jh2gut,723epsilon,2025-03-22 06:40:59,723,"[Advice] I'm 38 and finally cracked the discipline code after failing for 15+ years. Here's the system that changed everything. I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

Skip the 15 years of failure I endured. Start here instead.",/r/productivity/comments/1jh2gut/advice_im_38_and_finally_cracked_the_discipline/

You were not only the class‚Äôs belle but one of the prettiest girl in school. Many school guys had their eyes on you, you were that attractive.

I was just an average boy in a sea of boys. In fact, I was the one who always got bullied in school by the other boys. 

I would steal gazes at you during lessons. It took me a lot of courage to ask you out for movie after lesson one day. We watched ‚ÄúNational Lampoon‚Äôs Vacation‚Äù at Capitol Theatre.

Our friendship grew with time and when I asked you to go ‚Äústeady‚Äù, I was surprised that you smiled and didn‚Äôt rejected me.

We went on and did our N levels and followed by our O levels in 1985. 

I know that you don‚Äôt like my choice of career, but you silently stood by me and supported me when i underwent my training in the academy. 

Our journey was never an easy path for either of us. You went on to join SIA as a stewardess. You were flying for a living while my career required me to work rotating shifts, this period of time were never easy for us. 

I am sure that during your flying career, there were many better off guys trying to win your heart, pilots, businessmen, etc.

You remain true and faithful to me all these while.

When I was deployed to Cambodia in 1992 as part of the UN peacekeeping mission, this was one of the biggest test for both of us. I was away for 6 months. You understood and again stood by me on my decision.

When we eventually got married in 1993, you not only used your own money and gave your parents as your dowry on my behalf but also choose to give up your career for me.

Our love stood the test of time from our first date. We went thru the 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s and now 20s. Some of them were turbulent time and You have sacrificed a lot for me and our children. You stood by me, took care of me and nursed me back to health on several occasions when I was injured during my duties. 

Now that our kids are all grown up and have their own families, it‚Äôs time for us to relax and do the things we want.

1jgwpg2,ThatGuyWithSomeSubs,2025-03-22 01:04:06,1482,"The community ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù towards Mark and Helly is insane Alternative title:Facing the consequences of his actions

We spent 2 seasons of this show talking about how innies are their own person, just to have the fanbase go tell iMark to end his life for someone he doesn‚Äôt know/care about, and frankly shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs crazy to see the lack of self-awareness some people have because I‚Äôm genuinely seeing things that sound like Lumon itself would say as a way to dehumanize innies.

There is so much grace given to Mark Scout, who chose to create an innie that is perpetually stuck at work. Then, again without consent, chose to reintegrate for his own needs with no concern for his other self. 

When iMark finds out he has a wife, what does he say? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nice name, Gemma.‚Äù 
When oMark finds out Mark is in love with someone? He talks to him like he‚Äôs a child that has a crush, refers to it as ‚Äúliking‚Äù someone, and doesn‚Äôt even care to get the name right. Remember how offended he was when Helena did the same thing to him? Looks like they have a lot more in common than it seems.

oMark doesn‚Äôt bring Petey up. Why? Because it‚Äôs not even a thought to him. He doesn‚Äôt think Petey‚Äôs life and relationship are significant enough to bring up, or even come up as a thought in his head. He brings up who iMark ‚Äúlikes‚Äù because he thinks it‚Äôs something that iMark can relate to, nothing more. 

When Mark tells him about the plan, he expects iMark to go along with it. Because the thought of iMark being an individual with his own wants and needs isn‚Äôt even in consideration. He expects iMark to drop everything he has, simply because he‚Äôs existed longer. Simply put, even face to face talking with his innie, Mark Scout still sees him as a disposable tool for his convenience.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to die, and get Mark Scout killed!‚Äù Okay, and why can‚Äôt that be his choice? Because his outie is perfectly fine with killing him. It‚Äôs a dumb stupid decision that only a kid would make? So is Mark S for being an alcoholic and getting surgery from someone that doesn‚Äôt know how to standardize a procedure. Why is oMark‚Äôs life more valuable than iMark‚Äôs? Why is iMark‚Äôs life and his love treated as something disposable?

Now onto Helly. The moment she chooses an action that benefits herself, she‚Äôs labelled as selfish. No, she‚Äôs labelled as cruel, and ‚Äúnot Helly‚Äù. Her expression is seen as smug, like the evil manipulative person Helena is. She doesn‚Äôt even ask him to stay, just moved that he chooses that on his own, and that turns her cruel? It‚Äôs like she isn‚Äôt given any grace, anything the viewer doesn‚Äôt like is suddenly a character flaw.

Well guess what? It‚Äôs Helly. God forbid she choose her own happiness for once. It‚Äôs funny because if Irving really were here, he‚Äôd be in full support of them.

Does Gemma deserve this? No, but Mark Scout certainly does, and Gemma faces the unfortunate consequence of his actions.",/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1jgwpg2/the_community_outrage_towards_mark_and_helly_is/

I was inspired by friends who are super into the northern lights after getting a chance to see the lights from their backyard in Michigan (picture 3)! I wanted to make a quilt for them and when I saw this pattern and found the panel, it was meant to be. 

To finish this one, I got it longarmed at my LQS and I LOVE how the design adds so much motion to the verticals. I was unsure if the waves would have enough effect but they turned out perfect!!

Growing up, ""Uncle Ted"" was always around. Originally, I played with his kids. Then, one day, his kids stopped being around and Ted disappeared too for a bit. He eventually re-entered the picture, but I never saw his kids again. I once asked my mom what happened to my friends and she said they went to live with other family members. I was pretty sheltered and raised in a ""don't talk back"" household, so it didn't seem odd at the time.

Ted seemed to always be around. He'd babysit me and my brother, take us places, always bought us gifts. He wasn't our biological uncle, but was close enough to our parents that he was around. Then when I was 13, he abruptly disappeared from our lives. I asked my parents what happened but wasn't told and basically again got the ""don't talk back, just move on"". I was a little sad but in time, got busy with other things and didn't think too much of it.

I'm now married with a daughter of my own. A few months back, I ran into Ted's ex-wife. I almost didn't recognize her as I hadn't seen her since I was young and played with their kids. I asked how her kids were doing. She was kind of awkward and basically said ""we don't keep in touch"". I thought that was a little odd but didn't want to push. I told my mom about the situation and she got a little weird. Finally, she said ""I guess it's time you found out the truth"".

She explained that Ted had been found with CSAM . He ended up taking a plea. He served only probation and had to go on a registry. Originally, his ex-wife didn't leave him. This lead to both of them losing custody of their kids and they went into the foster system, later being adopted. His ex did eventually leave him. My mom claims that Ted made a bunch of excuses, tried to say he was framed. I asked my mom if she really believed that. She admitted, no, she never did, but Ted was so convincing that she didn't see harm in letting him be around. I asked what changed and she said they cut him off when he started dating a 16 year old while he was in his 40s. My parents were disgusted but Ted kept parroting ""age of consent"" laws and claimed there was nothing wrong. Given I was only 3 years away from 16 at the time, it hit too close to home, and they cut things off.

I was disgusted. I told my mom she was completely irresponsible. She tried to say ""but he never did anything"". I said no, but that's really a risk she was willing to take? I couldn't believe her. I couldn't trust her. I also wasn't sure if I could trust my own memories. I was in therapy for other things and after discussing this with my therapist in several sessions, we concluded while I wasn't abused, I was most likely groomed by Ted and there's a chance he was trying to get me to enter a relationship with him when I became of age. I was sick. My brother doesn't want to seek therapy and doesn't think he was being groomed, but also feels disgusted.

I've spoken to my husband about this. He no longer trusts my parents' judgment either. My parents have apologized, but we feel it isn't enough. We went severely low contact and when we do see them, they are not allowed alone with my daughter. I don't trust their judgment. They say this is an overreaction. They made a mistake years ago and corrected it. I said yes, but only after basically leaving us to be sold out. Other family says we need to be easier on my parents and that hindsight is 20/20.

One member even gets a gig as the Korean voice for The Little Mermaid even though she doesn't have voice acting experience and the vocal talent for it.

1jh1j4z,SilvanSoulSmith,2025-03-22 05:34:54,670,"My 16 yo sweet girl and I said goodbye for the last time She would have been 17 in June and I always thought she'd be around so much longer. But just in the last 9 months she began having vision problems, less activity, muscle loss, then finally appetite issues and began to really decline. 
She pushed through so many challenges, changes, and health issues through the years and I think she just became a forever constant for my life. 
But we found out it was cancer and there wasn't going to be any pushing through this one. 
So we took a weekend and hung onto each other before I took her to the vet wrapped up with some of her favorite toys in her favorite blanket and held her, whispering in her ear as she left. And now I can't even comprehend that 2/25 was weeks ago, it still feels like yesterday.

I still think I see her out of the corner of my eye some days. Others I do routines or habits that I haven't had with her in some time without thinking. But mostly I just miss how matter of fact she was. 
At my side every morning waking and every night going to sleep. She would typically walk me to the door when I left and greet me when I came back. Talking to me all the while.
And her fur. Her belly was so soft and over the years she finally let me just plant my face in her softest wispies. And I would take regular breaks from work to interrupt her napping for scritches and cuddles.

Looking back I see so much more clearly how bonded and in love we were. She really became a snuggler and a lap cat after years of being an independent huntress and ruler of the cul-de-sac. (Four squirrels and two uninjured hummingbirds in one week!)

Ms. Felicity Bustle. Cici, originally crazy cat. 
No one will ever hold my heart like you did.
Singular, beautiful. So very cat in the best cat way.

I'll miss you forever. I'll think of you often and feel you holding onto me when I carried you. The weight of your head laying on my chest. The roughness of the chin scritches you loved. Love bites with your one chipped tooth. The heat of a furball against the back of my knee curled up under the covers. The way you hugged my arm when snuggling in bed. 
I hope there's something more on the other side and I hope I'll see you there one day. Forever is too long without you, sweet girl. ",/r/seniorkitties/comments/1jh1j4z/my_16_yo_sweet_girl_and_i_said_goodbye_for_the/

1jh0g3n,Remarkable-Patient75,2025-03-22 04:26:14,587,"AITA for being more excited about my moms pregnancy than my stepmoms? I (16f) have divorced parents. They divorced when I was 10 years old after my dad cheated. The court gave my parents 50/50 custody. My dad (48) quickly married his mistress Molly (36) (fake name) and he also adopted Molly's 2 other kids, Grace (10) and Oliver (7) (both fake names). I didn't find out about my dads cheating until I was 13 and my uncle (on my moms side) let it slip while drunk during a family gathering. When I confronted my dad he tried denying it but the stuttering and the red face gave it away. After that I lost all respect for my dad and Molly.

I don't like Molly. She split up my family and keeps trying to force a relationship between us, even introducing me to her friends as 'her daughter' or 'her special daughter'. I've asked her to stop but she won't. She even tries calling me about random things when I'm at my moms house, I used to pick up but now I just ignore them. I don't see her as a mother figure and I never will.

My mom (39) took the divorce hard, but slowly started rebuilding her life and 2 years ago she met Greg (49). Greg is the greatest. He and I get on very well and we have the same interests. He also doesn't try to force a relationship between us and gives me all the space I need. 

Recently my dad and Molly sat me, Grace and Oliver down to announce that Molly was pregnant. Grace and Oliver were ecstatic and I congratulated them but wasn't jumping up and down as much as Grace and Oliver. Something about her being the one to have my half sibling is just wrong. The woman who split up a family is now starting her own with my dad. 

Well, not long after my mom came to me and told me she and Greg were expecting as well. Of course I was more excited for this since my mom is like my best friend, Greg and I have a fantastic relationship and I know that they'd be great parents. I guess Molly realized I was quite happy about something and asked what. Here's where I might be the asshole. Instead of just saying my mom was pregnant, I kind of went on a rant about how excited I was and how I can't wait to met the baby and how I wanted to plan a huge baby shower etc. Molly nodded along and didn't say much else. I didn't think much of it until my dad came into my room that night and sat on my bed. He says Molly's feelings were really hurt that I didn't show the same excitement for her pregnancy than I did for my moms and that I shouldn't feel any different towards her because they are both carrying my half-siblings and that I needed to apologize to her and 'fix my attitude'. I listened to him but the more he talked the more angry I got. I told him that if she wasn't a homewrecker than I'd be more happy and they shouldn't expect the same treatment from me that I give my mom because I have little respect for them and their blended family they force down my throat. My dad went off at me, saying what he and my mom went through was none of mu business and if I wasn't such a brat then I'd realize that him and Molly are trying their hardest to get through to me and have a relationship. He said I was 16 and needed to stop acting so juvenile etc. He then took my phone (I'm typing this on my laptop), grounded me and left without another word, refusing to hear me out. Its only Tuesday and I still have a whole week until next Monday with them. Tensions are high but honestly I don't feel like apologizing or starting to act different around Molly. However I know that he's my dad and I probably shouldn't've called her a homewrecker and she's pregnant but I just don't know what to do, so like AITA, should I apologize and move on?",/r/AITAH/comments/1jh0g3n/aita_for_being_more_excited_about_my_moms/

For an example - my colleague used to take 4 days for a job.. I being efficient - and after sacrificing my personal life and working my ass off for the company, I complete it in 2 days..

The new benchmark now would be 2 days.. and in exigency, they'll ask to complete the same stuff in 1.5 days - which when you wouldn't deliver (because you are already at your 100% at 2 days), you'll be labelled as inefficient.

Give your 60-70% exertion at work place (eg complete in 3.5 days in this case) - which will be decent, and when the boss / manager wants something quick - expand it to 100% (say 2 days) thus being valuable when required and getting the most brownie points - that the guy does stretch himself when we require him to.

That way you'll have work life balance, Annndd you'll be in good books of the management.",/r/jobs/comments/1jh0k7l/never_give_your_100_at_your_job_heres_why/

I don‚Äôt know her name, but she answers to Mega Boy or Puti. Or I think she answers the call because she recognizes my voice.

My family and I have been feeding strays sa village namin. Mainly because we tend to have left overs, so imbes na itapon, pinapakin na lang namin sa mga aso. 

One afternoon, months ago, nakita ko sya. Skin and bones, andaming galis and madaming sugat sa katawan. Sinubukan ko na lapitan sya but she always ran away. I tried offering dog treats pero ayaw nya talaga. So i had to leave the food sa floor at hayaan na sya lumapit. This went on for months and i tried my best to show her na i meant no harm. 

The reason im writing this post kasi I want to share the joy i felt last night. It was evening, and i just finished feeding our dogs (2 adult female and 4 puppies) and saw Mega Boy sitting outside our gate. Kumuha ako ng pinalambot na dog food (i always have it prepared for her), and as soon as lumabas ako ng gate namin , tumingin sya sa akin at biglang nag tatalon talon (like how dogs are when they are excited)

Di na sya tumakbo palayo and she let me pet her. Grabe yung emotions .. naiyak ako. I don‚Äôt know what she went through pero i was so happy na she finally considered me as someone she could trust. 

Nakakataba ng puso and until now naiiyak ako when i think about it. Yun lang po‚Ä¶

PS. Pakonti konti lang po binibigay ko sa kanya na food kasi ayoko na mabigla yung stomach. Unfortunately, hindi frequent ang kain nya as i dont know san sya natutulog. But i feed her everytime she shows up sa gate namin. 

I mix vitamins sa food na binibigay ko. So far, wounds are gone, ung galis nag hheal na din and mjo nagkaka laman na sya. 

She has started to bark slightly na (before tahimik lang talaga sya) but it is a bit raspy.

PPS. I can‚Äôt adopt her completely since marami na dn kami dogs and budget is limited. Ung rescue aspin ko is also very selosa. Tried reaching out so pet rescue groups pero hindi pa din nag rreply.

As I plan to use them as bodyguards, I went ahead and individualized them to match some different regiment styles and just to experiment. If I had to make more though I l'd stick with a bunch of Cadian style, I think it turned out best.

It's baffling to me just how good this series is in every aspect and it's both funny and sad that the only other competition this series can get in terms of quality, when it comes to horror shows, is Mike Flanagan's other shows. 

The acting by both the children and adult actors; the cinematography; the score; the message; the pacing, the effectiveness; the extremely well written characters; the metaphors.

EPISODE. FUCKING. FIVE.

One of the best things I've ever watched. There is not a single wasted shot. Mike Flanagan is terrific at depicting just how goddamn amazing you can make the haunted house trope.

Well I tell him in response to that the last guy on Monday didn‚Äôt think so. He let me go at a certain time and then called my coordinator the next day to say I left without permission‚Ä¶.

He‚Äôs taken aback by this like he can‚Äôt believe what he‚Äôs hearing. He then proceeds to look at the ER board schedule and asks me who the attending was.

1jgsvnx,excusetheblood,2025-03-21 22:04:19,1644,"To the landscape man who found a decaying body at the Promenade Rio Vista apartments on Rio San Diego dr: That body was my sister. I‚Äôm sure it was upsetting to you to discover a body that had been out in the open air and rain for at least a week, hidden from the road, I‚Äôm sure your response to that traumatic experience included thoughts like ‚Äújust another tweaker who OD‚Äôd‚Äù.    

I just thought you‚Äôd like to know that she was a whole person with a whole life. She was loved and she loved others. She got involved with drugs and alcohol at many points in her life, and she relapsed as often as she went to rehab. I‚Äôve been racking my brain trying to figure out how she turned out the way that she did. Why didn‚Äôt she stay clean that last time? She had been off drugs for 2 years. She was raising four kids who depended on her. Was she born with the wrong brain? Was she born into the wrong family? Was she not offered the right kind of help? There are so many unknowns.    

I knew it was the beginning of the end when I went to her house for Thanksgiving in 2023. She dropped a ton of weight, she was jittery and jumpy, her thoughts were disorganized. Shortly after, she confided in me that she suspected everyone around her was involved in some sort of mind-control conspiracy against her. That some sort of satanic sex trafficking cult was targeting her and her kids. I listened without challenging, I knew she was too far from reality to be reasoned with. She had begun seeing evil spirits. I had to call cps, I knew she had started smoking meth again.    

I don‚Äôt know if cps ever followed up. All I know is that in March of 2024, she packed up all her kids without warning in the middle of the night and began driving states away to ‚Äúkeep them safe‚Äù. She ended up in Arizona, where cps took custody of the kids. She was homeless and alone once again. She took a greyhound bus to San Diego, why I‚Äôll never know, and that‚Äôs where she stayed. The last time I spoke with her was August. She called me from a Kingdom Hall of Jehovahs Witnesses, the religion we were raised in as children, she said it was the only place she was safe from the mind control demons. She asked me to help her convince cps to give her back her 4 kids, she said it was unfair that they ever took them and that they weren‚Äôt safe. Her ex husband, our grandparents, cps, the cops, the judges, all of them were working together to take the kids and sacrifice them somehow to this trafficking cult.    

At that moment I decided I was done patiently listening. I was angry, I confronted her in that moment and told her ‚Äúthere is no such thing as mind control, there is no such thing as Satan and demons, and there is no secret cult targeting you. You need help, you got back on meth and are experiencing a psychotic episode‚Äù. She hung up on me right then.    

From then on I knew it was only a matter of time. I was worried, in fact, that she would die without any sort of identification on her and we would have to go our whole lives not knowing. I can only assume she sank further into drug use on the San Diego streets.    

I‚Äôm not sure what else to say. I hope San Diego was a good home to her in her last days. I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs not suffering anymore. It must be awful to have to live in such a deep state of terror constantly. ",/r/sandiego/comments/1jgsvnx/to_the_landscape_man_who_found_a_decaying_body_at/

I don't know how to explain the feeling of loss of a beloved pet, but it has been awful to deal with. I told my boss right away when my dog was diagnosed with brain stem cancer and was very transparent when I needed to take time off when it was time to let him go. They designed this project for me while I was gone and it must have been worked on behind the scenes because I was completely surprised by it. I feel very grateful to be surrounded by both talented artists and people who care so much about me.

My only nitpick is that the pockets sewn on top of the lining for the dress, so you can see them/their outline but aside from that it‚Äôs really well made. From behind, the top part lays against the upper back perfectly so there‚Äôs no gap that some dresses have, leading to a really nice feminine curve with how it sits.

1jgvcm0,Character_Regret2639,2025-03-21 23:57:53,1101,"Stray boy just wants to sleep after coming inside Hi everyone. So I‚Äôve made several posts here about a stray boy I found and bringing him inside. He is friendly and I was able to get him into a crate and to a cat rescue where they checked him for chip and if not claimed they were going to vet him and I‚Äôd adopt. Well, he was claimed. I was shocked because he was in such rough shape when he came to me. Long story short, I connected with his former owners and he had been missing six whole years. I‚Äôd only fed him about three months so we don‚Äôt know what he was up to that whole time. He‚Äôs 7-8 now. For a variety of reasons they asked me if I wanted to keep him and I said yes absolutely. He came home Tuesday to my guest bedroom/husband‚Äôs office. We first had him in a large cat cage but he has been fine so he‚Äôs had access to the whole room during the day. 

Anyway, poor guy seems so exhausted and I‚Äôm a little worried about him? His former owner was a vet, believe it or not, so they vetted him and he stayed at their vet hospital for about four days because I was out of town for a funeral when they called and asked if I wanted to keep him. Before that he was at a cat rescue for five or so days. I know this was probably all incredibly stressful for him. Unfortunately he also picked up a mild upper respiratory virus that we are monitoring but seems to be improving. So he‚Äôs been going through it. He‚Äôs been eating, drinking, peeing and pooping normally but all he wants to do is sleep on the bed and eat basically. At what point should I worry? My husband pointed out he probably has had to sleep with one eye open for the past six years, so maybe he‚Äôs just finally able to feel safe and relax. And he‚Äôs not a kitten by any means. I feel so bad for him but he‚Äôs safe, warm and loved now. He‚Äôs also terrified of the outside noises and hid under the bed when he heard the garbage truck outside. He‚Äôs been perfectly well behaved though and using his litter box perfectly. 

I‚Äôm curious to hear others‚Äô experiences after they brought ferals or strays in? How did they act the first few weeks? Thanks everyone. This group has been such a help to me throughout this process!",/r/Feral_Cats/comments/1jgvcm0/stray_boy_just_wants_to_sleep_after_coming_inside/

1.¬†¬†¬† Kindness is the best deal going. You can keep giving it and it doesn‚Äôt cost you anything.

2.¬†¬†¬† You can only be offended if you let yourself be offended.¬†

3.¬†¬†¬† When someone is drowning, don‚Äôt tell them they should have taken swimming lessons.  
Help first. Educate second.

4.¬†¬†¬† Your struggles today will be your accomplishments tomorrow. Keep going.

5.¬†¬†¬† Building resilience isn‚Äôt something that comes and goes with your mood. Resilience is your intention and becomes a part of you. When that happens, nothing can stop you.

6.¬†¬†¬† At 23 I worried what people thought of me.  
At 43 I realized they weren‚Äôt even thinking about me.  
At 73 I really don‚Äôt care that much about what people do think of me.  
Adopt that one early.

7.¬†¬†¬† Books are like the years in your life. It's not how many you have, it‚Äôs how good they are.

8.¬†¬†¬† With hope you can endure and accomplish anything.¬†

9.¬†¬†¬† What you think of me is none of my business.

10. Nobody gets to their deathbed upset they tried too many things. But plenty of people get there with regrets for the things they didn‚Äôt try.

11. You can only be in a bad mood if you let yourself.

12. Being grateful is a cheat sheet for happiness.

13. The pain you feel today is the strength you‚Äôll feel tomorrow. Keep pushing forward.

14. Never say anything to yourself that you wouldn‚Äôt say to a loved one.

15. We make the best decisions we can, with the information we have at that time.  
Give yourself a break.

16. Say something. Do something. Be something.

17. Believe in yourself. Don‚Äôt listen to the critics. They‚Äôre either envious or they can‚Äôt do it themselves.

18. Your age is up to you. I‚Äôm 73 but I believe and act like I‚Äôm 19. Find your¬†*happy*¬†age. It‚Äôs more important than the years.

19. Action is the medicine for Fear of Failure. Just start moving.

20. Lead with your heart but manage with your head.¬†I absolutely made that mistake. More than once.

21. You will never go wrong being too kind to someone. Sometimes it will feel like they are taking advantage of you. But that‚Äôs on them, not you.

22. You can tell the strength of a relationship by the number of calluses on the upper lip from biting it.

23. Don‚Äôt stay stuck on every idea. Trees bend for a reason.

24. To become successful, be useful. Be useful to enough people and success will find you.

25. Life doesn‚Äôt come with an unlimited number of chances. Don‚Äôt hesitate.

26. Forgetting something is the universe‚Äôs way of telling you to be more present.

27. If you don‚Äôt expect anything, you‚Äôll never be disappointed.

28. I‚Äôm not anti-social. I‚Äôm just not very pro-social.

29. So little time. So many books.

30. Everyone has their first day on the job. Give them a break.

31. Money is important to have (and usually necessary), until your happiness becomes more important.

32. It isn‚Äôt over until YOU say it‚Äôs over.

33. My best tip and hope for us: Live and let live.

If you're lucky enough to get up to my age, the view becomes clearer.  
Sometimes you‚Äôll be up and sometimes you‚Äôll be down.  
But nothing ever stays the same. And that's ok.  
Enjoy the ride.

Onward!  
Louie

1jgv5cr,hikarinaraba,2025-03-21 23:48:01,1115,"I spent my partner‚Äôs money on Furina but something unexpected happened My partner (28F) and I (29M) have been together for a few years now, and everything‚Äôs been great. But recently, I did something incredibly stupid.

I‚Äôve been playing Genshin religiously, and they just announced in the 5.4 livestream that Furina is rerunning. I knew I HAD to get her, and her C6 even to show how much I love her. I was so hyped, she was my pride and joy, my reason why I started playing the game. But there was some problem. I was out of primos after accidentally geting a 5 star while building pity on the previous banner. I told myself I‚Äôd just spend a little, but one thing led to another, and before I knew it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd spent $600 to get her C6. And guess what, it wasn‚Äôt even¬†my¬†money. Yeah, I used the shared emergency fund under my partner's card. I thought I‚Äôd be lucky to get some earlies and won 50/50s, but of course, RNG said ‚Äúnuh uh.‚Äù

Anyway, I thought I could hide it. But nope. She checked the statement, and the look she gave me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never felt so ashamed in my life. She was pissed, and rightfully so. I tried to apologize, but she just stared at me for a minute and said:

‚ÄúNot even an R5 is a disgrace.‚Äù

I was so confused. I mean, I messed up, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting¬†that.¬†Then she did something that broke my mind, she handed me another $600 and told me to ‚Äúdo it properly.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if she genuinely meant it, or if it was a test, a trap, or some kind of power move, but now I‚Äôm just sitting here with a C6R5 Furina and a weird sense of guilt. She hasn‚Äôt really talked to me about it since, and I have no idea where we stand.

So yeah, AITA? ",/r/furinamains/comments/1jgv5cr/i_spent_my_partners_money_on_furina_but_something/

1jghxn5,rodejo_9,2025-03-21 14:20:28,8380,"Warframe Appreciation Post + Huge Giveaway (Over 2000+ plat of value) I just want to say,

I've been playing Warframe since late 2018, and ever since then I fell in love with the game. Storytelling? Excellent. Gameplay? Phenomenal. Graphics and artstyles? Gorgeous. With an S-tier dev team, and overall great community, it's no wonder why I consider Warframe one of my favorite games of all time. 

Warframe helped to get me out of some of the darkest times of my life when I was quite literally at my lowest. I'm not going to go into too much detail but this game is a big stress reliever for me and a great escape for when I want to decompress. And that's not at all an exaggeration.

With all that being said, I'm doing a huge giveaway valued at over 2000+ total platinum to kind of give back to the community. The items include:

Any Gemini Skin of choice  
Temple Warframe   
Formas    
Any Color Palette of choice   

RULES:   

To be eligible all you have to do is have a Reddit account at least 3 months old (so less chance of scammers) and leave a comment with your in-game platform and username, and I'll pick 3 winners by random. Then after 24hrs I'll message the winners and gift them the items through the game. Best of luck Tenno!",/r/Warframe/comments/1jghxn5/warframe_appreciation_post_huge_giveaway_over/

As an example he says his 94 year old mother-in-law won't call to complain if she missed getting her monthly check.  She would probably expect her son-in-law to help her out for the month.  Won't she be surprised when he tells her to pull up her orthopedic boot straps. Then any attempt to call the Social Security would be futile because Lutnick and his toadies cut off telephone service at the SS.

This type of comment demonstrates how out of touch these oligarchs are and how if left in power the damage they will do to the USA. Remember Marie Antoinette.

They both started drawing social security at 62. My mother has a small pension from her public sector job. Their net worth was/is smaller than mine is now (age 40). They will likely still have 1 million + remaining when they pass away. They just don‚Äôt spend very much money. I think many of us way overestimate what we are going to need in retirement and it extends our working lives far beyond what they need to be. Obviously everyone‚Äôs lifestyle and situation will be different but if your goal is to stop working full time as soon as possible it can likely be done sooner than you think.

Toward the end of the session, our barbarian heard voices emanating from the bottom of a mineshaft which led to our jumpy wizard tossing a fireball straight down the mineshaft without even checking who was there. Luckily for her conscious, it was a group of bad guys who managed to survive it. This led to a fight. As a last ditch effort, my DM starts describing this detailed intricate spell and really got into it. As the enemy spell caster is about to unleash Ice storm on us, I interrupted with ""counter spell 4th level!"" The look in my DMs face was priceless. In a second, he went from happy, to frustrated, to resigned and stoic. Then he told me to go F myself. The way he said it is hard to describe, but it was so funny, and the tone was very resigned and defeated. I think he forgot that I picked counter spell.

So this happened earlier today, and I still want to crawl into a hole.

I work remotely, and we had a big Zoom meeting with several higher-ups in attendance. I was just listening in, so I muted myself and decided to grab a quick snack from the kitchen. My AirPods were in, and I was still connected to the meeting while I rummaged through my cabinets.

Now, my dog has this habit of sneaking into the kitchen whenever I open a bag of chips. So as soon as I ripped open a bag, I whispered, ‚ÄúYou sneaky little bastard, I see you.‚Äù

Except‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt whispering to myself. I was still connected to the meeting.

I didn‚Äôt realize anything was wrong until I heard dead silence, followed by my manager saying, ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ who are you talking to?‚Äù

At this point, I froze. I checked my screen, and sure enough, the little green microphone icon was ON. I panicked and blurted out, ‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶ my dog.‚Äù

Cue awkward laughter from a few people, but I could tell some of the higher-ups were NOT amused. One of them dryly said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try to keep the side conversations to a minimum.‚Äù

The worst part? The meeting was being RECORDED for future reference. So now, my little outburst is officially immortalized in company history.

TL;DR ‚Äì Forgot my AirPods were connected, called my dog a sneaky bastard during an important Zoom meeting, and now it‚Äôs recorded forever.

1jgp6yt,MrTechnodad,2025-03-21 19:25:49,2059,"Alex's House Hey everyone. Mr. Technodad here. 

As I've discussed previously, Alex bought a house in his last year. One of the last conversations we had was about what would happen to the house. He indicated he wanted us to keep it and rent it out so it would go to house some other family and our family could still keep the benefit. So in my mind that kind of has ""last wishes"" kind of status.

So we've done all the work and today, a new family moves into his house.

I admit that I am glad this is happening but also I'm feeling Some Kind of Way about the whole thing. Some kind of complicated way in fact. Floof can tell something is up and he keeps nosing my hand as I'm typing this.

All of Alex's furniture has been disposed of. Some of it has been returned to where it was borrow from. (Yay I get my couch back.) Apollo got Alex's old bed from the master bedroom. Artemis got a bookcase because she has lots of books, and we got a new lamp for the tv room. Little Alex-related artifacts still float around our lives.

I love you guys. I'm so thankful that you're all still here. May you all continue on the path of righteousness.

GW: 153lbs 

Hello everyone it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve made an update on my Mounjaro journey. I got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the summer of 2022. My highest weight was 253lbs. I was immediately prescribed metformin because my A1C was 8.2. The metformin helped me lose weight and brought my A1C down and it is now technically in remission. I started taking Mounjaro in June of 2024, my weight was 219lbs. I am now 165lbs, 12lbs away from my goal weight. I have lost almost a total of 88lbs. I have lost 54lbs since starting Mounjaro. To say that I am speechless and proud is the understatement of the century. I never in a million years thought I would get to this stage of my life. I still struggle to grasp that I‚Äôve arrived. I still see the girl I was in that first image but logically I know that I‚Äôm the girl in the last photo. I struggle with body dysmorphia very badly but I am working on it. I cannot begin to express how blessed and grateful I am to have been able to go on this journey, especially with all of you beautiful souls. You all give me courage and strength to keep going and I feel incredibly privileged to be a part of this amazing community. Thank you all for coming along on this journey with me and I wish you all the best success!! We‚Äôve got this!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòò

Most car dealerships are truly awful. But! A family owned juggernaut may actually relieve me of this car, pay the remaining balance and come to sort of agreement so that my mind be at ease.

1jglvau,_Angiebtv,2025-03-21 17:07:50,2748,"WE DID IT! I can honestly say that our wedding day was the best day yet! We were married on March 2 in Chicago at a beautiful industrial type of venue called Ovation Chicago. We were engaged for a year and a half and boy did I need all of that time to prepare. I was in charge of basically everything for the wedding and I must say, I think I did a pretty darned good job, especially for not having a coordinator.

My husband and I had a  
budget of $10K and unfortunately, we went over about $3K. I will say though, we  
would have spent even more of our own money, but I had lot of help from my side  
of the family. Without my family's help, we would have spent around $20K.

I honestly just wanted to  
give a quick breakdown along with tips/tricks about our day that might help  
others when it comes to budgeting: \*preface, I have a big family and a lot of  
the women are very crafty so this helped when it came to DIY'ing\*

**Venue:** We chose to have our wedding at Ovation Chicago  
on a Sunday during their off-peak season for $5k total. The venue is a steal  
IMO because of all the extra amenities!! It includes, a Rolls Royce car that  
you can drive around after the ceremony and take pics with your photographer, a  
DJ from their extensive DJ list, a built in photobooth, a grand piano, custom  
graphic designs, their own even liaisons, security, games like foosball, darts,  
ping pong, a bridal suite, and much more. Spencer, the manager, is great at  
what he does! [https://www.ovationchicago.com/](https://www.ovationchicago.com/)

**Decor:** My godmother, two of my aunt's, and my mom  
handled all of the decor from the ceremony to the dinner tables. Everything was  
either already owned or bought from Amazon/Dollar Tree. We used all disposable  
dinnerware which made cleanup a breeze! We also did not use 1 single real  
flower, not even my bouquet. Flowers are overpriced IMO, and they die so fast  
that I was okay with not having the real thing.

**Food:** Dinner was the most expensive but worth it in my  
opinion. We spent a little over $5k on full service and the caterer and her  
team did a phenomenal job. She even gave us and our guests a complimentary  
surprise sweet treat after dinner, huge taffy apples and chocolate covered  
strawberries for everyone! We bought out cutting cake from Nothing Bundt Cake  
and we bought a vanilla and chocolate sheet cake from Costco to serve along  
with popcorn I bought from Amazon. Anyone interested here's her website [https://www.ladydkitchen.com/](https://www.ladydkitchen.com/) I will most definitely be contacting her when we are ready for a  
baby shower, the green beans were a HIT!!!!

**Liquor:** We chose a bartending service that gave us  
different options based off what we could afford. We chose to have 3 signature drinks,  
and we chose to have them provide everything except for the actual spirits and  
beer. They gave us a comprehensive shopping list and brought everything else.  
We also are wine club members at Coopers Hawk, so we decided to let the bottles  
accumulate the entire time we were engaged, and we were able to have 40 bottles  
of wine. Here's the bartending service I used. She runs her company from Florida,  
but she has staff working in Chicago for her as well. [https://www.mgmbartending.com/](https://www.mgmbartending.com/)

**Attire:** I wore 2 dresses which totaled $500, My ceremony  
dress was from Lulus at $400 and my party dress was from Fashion Nova at $100.  
My husband‚Äôs suit was bought by Men's Warehouse and fortunately he didn't need  
any alterations and paid about $500 for everything. All of my accessories and  
shoes came from Amazon. [www.lulus.com](http://www.lulus.com) [www.fashionnova.com](http://www.fashionnova.com)

**Photography:** I was able to find a terrific photographer found  
in Chicago. We paid a little under $1k for over 1100 photos, which were given  
to us 3 days after our wedding. Ruben, at G&R Photography, went above and  
beyond taking photos by literally helping me unpack my U-Haul truck. I couldn't  
have asked for a better service. We decided against videography, as it wouldn't  
fit in with our budget. My godmother recorded the entire ceremony and put it on  
a CD for us. [https://www.g-rphotography.com/](https://www.g-rphotography.com/)",/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1jglvau/we_did_it/

Let‚Äôs be honest: you‚Äôll never win the lottery.

On the other hand, chances are pretty high that you‚Äôll slave away at some shitty job the rest of your life.

That‚Äôs because in all likelihood you were born into the wrong social class. Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî you‚Äôre a member of the WORKING CASTE.

As a result, you don‚Äôt have the education, upbringing, connections, manners, appearance, and good taste to ever become one of us.

In fact, you‚Äôd probably need a book the size of the yellow pages to list all the unfair advantages we have over you.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre so relieved that you continue to believe the silly old fairy tale about ‚Äújustice‚Äù and ‚Äúequal opportunity‚Äù in America.

Of course, in a hierarchical system like ours, there‚Äôs not much room at the top to begin with. And anyway, it‚Äôs already occupied by us (in fact we like it up here so much that we intend to keep it that way).

But at least there‚Äôs usually someone lower in the social hierarchy you can feel superior to and kick in the teeth once in a while. Even a lowly dishwasher can find some poor slob even lower than he to sneer and spit at.

So be thankful for poor Blacks, migrant workers, prostitutes and homeless street people.

Always remember that if everyone like you were economically secure and socially privileged like us, there would be no one left to fill those boring, dangerous shit jobs in our economy. And no one to fight our wars or blindly follow orders in our corporate armies. And certainly no one to meekly go to their grave without having lived a full and creative life.

So please, keep up the good work!

Plus, you probably don‚Äôt have the same vicious, greedy, compulsive drive to acquire and possess wealth, power and prestige that we have. And even though you sincerely desire freedom, you also fear freedom, keeping you and others like you in a nervous state of limbo.

So you mechanically go through life playing your assigned social role, terrified of what others would think should you ever dare to ‚Äúbreak out of the mold.‚Äù

Naturally we play you off against each other whenever it suits our purposes: skilled workers against unskilled, unionized against non-unionized, Black against White, American workers against Japanese against Mexican against....

We continually keep your wages low by invoking ‚Äúforeign competition,‚Äù ‚Äúthe law of supply and demand,‚Äù or ‚Äúnational security.‚Äù

We throw you into the unemployed if you step out of line or jeopardize our profits.

We even let you vote for one of our political surrogates every now and then.

Happily, you haven‚Äôt a clue as to what‚Äôs really happening ‚Äî instead you blame Blacks, Jews, Welfare Mothers, Queers (everybody except us) for your troubled situation.

Not only that, you still embrace the work ethic, even though most jobs in our economy undermine your health, poison the environment, and suck your one and only life out of you.

We don‚Äôt know much about work, but we‚Äôre sure glad that you do.

Of course life could be different.

Society could be organized to meet the real needs of the general population.

You could control your own activity and not be someone else‚Äôs pawn.

But you don‚Äôt know that. You can‚Äôt even imagine it.

In fact, that‚Äôs probably the greatest accomplishment of our system: robbing you of your imagination, your creativity, your ability to think for yourself.

So we‚Äôd truly like to thank you from the bottom of our heartless hearts. It‚Äôs obedient wage slaves like you that help make our lives so pleasant. Your loyal sacrifice makes possible our corrupt luxury; your work makes our system work.

So once again, thanks for ‚Äúknowing your place‚Äù ‚Äî without even knowing it.

$igned,
Rich $cum of America

The real ‚Äúgolden rule‚Äù: He who has the gold makes the rules.
‚ÄúWe play, you pay!‚Äù

1jgutk9,d0sag3,2025-03-21 23:32:38,698,"My player said my DM style is unfair. For  context, I am a forever  DM (no one else will do it). I enjoy it when the players have fun so I don't mind too much. I'm one of those DMs who spend months creating a deep lore, world, maps, etc. I put a ton of work in. However, when it comes to actually playing, the world is there for the players to interact with, but they can do whatever they want - I'll make it work. I try to set up potential for any and every possible type of interaction for my campaigns (puzzles, battles, treasure, secrets, lore, etc) and then head into whatever direction the players take it.

I recently started playing with a new group. We played two sessions. They all had a blast. One player in particular talked about the game nonstop and how excited he was to play the next time. In between sessions, he asked for some stuff for his character. I had to decline due to fairness to the other players. I offered him a compromise, but it was not to his liking. He then criticized me and said I am unfair because I don't offer any chance for treasures and loot. He quit the game on the spot. After a loooooong discussion about me trying to explain how there are plenty of potential opportunities (and because he was a friend, even going as far as to show him my DM notes from that campaign), he said every opportunity I had in the world was completely unfair.

The example that became his biggest point of contention was the following. While playing (our first session), he came across a magical den, which looked like something dark had been there recently. The players explored, and his character found a ring. He put the ring on, and I described a sensation of his character feeling sleepy. He immediately threw the ring away and never looked back. I informed him that this was a magical ring, which was quite valuable. He said, 'How dare you! You can not make an item seem cursed and then claim that as an opportunity for treasure. That is unfair!' He held to this belief and found a similar issue with every single example I had in the world....  He refused to reconsider playing and said the way I play is absolutely unfair to the players.

From my perspective, I don't think this is even remotely unfair. I also fail to see how someone can go from having a blast to thinking everything is unfair in the snap of a finger. Games are meant to have twists and turns, and it's up to the player to determine how they want to approach them. Regardless, the campaign died after session 2 because his brother then decided he probably shouldn't continue playing considering the situation (2 players are not easy to replace where I am). 

As players, do y'all find this type of situation unfair? What types of scenarios do you like and don't like to be presented with?

Edit(s): I didn't tell him about the magic ring until our long conversation, which was weeks after the second session (the ring thing happened in the first session) and right after he had quit. I was trying to remedy the situation more so because this was a group of friends that regularly see each other. He never really acted like this before this moment (at least not in front of me).

Tl;dr: apparently it's unfair to present treasure in any way that 'seems' dangerous...",/r/DnD/comments/1jgutk9/my_player_said_my_dm_style_is_unfair/

Then I discovered a different food bank that gave actually good and edible food. I went last month and went again today. Every month I was living with my cabinets and fridge/freezer empty except for some condiments. I went hungry for days. Which is dangerous with my medical conditions. All I ever had at the end of the month was protein powder to keep me alive. Since accessing the good food bank twice I‚Äôve gone from starving at the end of every month to actually having a bit of backstock in case of an emergency (I.e. my benefits not showing up on time). I am so thankful to the food banks for providing what they can. And I am so thankful to not be in fear of starving at the end of every month anymore.

1jgvd24,ghgustafson,2025-03-21 23:58:30,639,"[Discussion] Do you agree? I have changed bracelets on my watches dozens of times over the years. I just put the bracelet back on my speedy. It‚Äôs relatively easy now. But I STILL hate it. Every time. Most enthusiasts love to change the look of their watches, and the outdated method of securing the strap needs revision. It‚Äôs time for all luxury watches to have some form of quick release mechanism, especially for bracelets.

So far the arguments against quick release bracelets are:

1. Who cares if you get a few scratches changing the bracelet! It‚Äôs a tool, it‚Äôs meant to be worn!

Rebuttal: I agree that these watches can be seen as tools‚Ä¶ but if I spend $5000+ on a tool, I still want to keep it in good shape, looking good, and I don‚Äôt want a headache every time I change the strap. 

2. If you are scratching your watch while changing straps, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.

Rebuttal: I am convinced there is no way to not at least somewhat scratch the lugs when using a simple spring bar tool. With a pliers-style removal tool, maybe you can do it cleanly. I get no one sees the underside of the lugs, but still‚Äî it shouldn‚Äôt be necessary to scratch them! 

3. The mechanism can break, and now you need to replace the whole endlink as opposed to a spring bar. 

Rebuttal: Not really a rebuttal, just a ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still worth it in my mind‚Äù. I‚Äôll take the quick release even with the risk of it needing maintenance.

4. Not an argument, but an explanation: it‚Äôs a way for the businesses to keep customers from altering the look of their product. They don‚Äôt want us changing the strap/bracelet, they want us buying their brand name strap and letting their watchmaker assemble it. 

What other arguments for/against do we got?

1jgle9v,Jfocii,2025-03-21 16:48:06,2424,"He cried quietly on the Metro and vanished into Delhi‚Äôs silence. It was almost 11 PM on a weekday, Blue Line, near-empty coach. You know the vibe..dimmed lights, that low hum of the AC, and the quiet that feels heavier than the day itself. I was on my seat, headphones in but no music playing . Across from me sat this man ..mid to late 40s, maybe older, hard to tell.

Shirt untucked, shoes scuffed, clutching a small black plastic bag like it carried something fragile. I noticed him fidgeting with a paper tucked inside..A HOSPITAL RECEIPT. I know because I saw the AIIMS logo on it when he adjusted it on his lap. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have stared, but Delhi turns you into both an observer and a ghost.

Then it happened. The tears.
Not loud, not messy just quiet, controlled streams running down as he stared dead ahead, like he was somewhere far away. It wasn‚Äôt the kind of crying you do when you lose a phone or fight with someone .The kind of grief that feels worn out, like he‚Äôs cried these tears before but still has more left.

I looked around two guys sharing memes, a couple laughing softly, and the usual tired souls glued to their phones. No one noticed him. Or maybe no one wanted to notice him. And there I was, frozen, feeling like I was intruding on someone‚Äôs most personal breakdown.

I wanted to say something.
But then, all the Delhi lessons kicked in ""mind your business,"" ""don‚Äôt get involved,"" .


So I sat there, doing nothing, feeling disgusted at how normal it felt to look away. When he got off at Mandi House, he wiped his face, straightened his shirt, and disappeared into the crowd like just another faceless commuter.

I stayed on the train but left with him.
Left wondering who did he lose? A child? A parent? Was it the hospital visit? The bill in that plastic bag? Or was it the weight of the city, that quiet violence of carrying grief alone in a place where no one has time to stop?


Delhi is a city where you can cry in public, and no one will ask why. And maybe that‚Äôs the scariest part.",/r/delhi/comments/1jgle9v/he_cried_quietly_on_the_metro_and_vanished_into/

1jguyyp,10thplanetwestLA,2025-03-21 23:39:49,1106,"Now I'm just going to park there ALL the time About a month ago, I moved into a residential neighborhood and it's important to note a few things as you read my story:  My house does not have a driveway or garage, so I have to rely on street parking.  This is not a gated/HOA governed area and there are no signs/restrictions/permits whatsoever for street parking.  This area is not walking distance to anything but other homes, so anyone parking on the street is either a resident of the area or visitor of a resident (no random people are trying to find short term parking).  

It's a quiet neighborhood, so I can usually find street parking in front of or close to my house.  However, there is one neighbor that lives 4 houses down that feels that they own the PUBLIC sidewalk in front of their property and puts down cones to block off space that would fit about 3 cars.  I refuse to give them the benefit of the doubt that they do this to save spots for themselves because I take my dog on frequent walks and I never have seen them use these spots to park.  Additionally, they have a long driveway that never has any cars in it and a detached garage, so they already have ample parking for their personal vehicles that I've never seen.  On that note, I have literally never even seen these neighbors.  Other than occasionally seeing lights coming from their backyard during night time walks, I would probably assume there was no one living there.  Shades are always closed in the front windows and never see any inside lights on from the front.  

One day, I drove home and there was no parking available except in front of their house.  It was late and I didn't want to park a block away just because of this entitled house, so I simply moved a couple of their cones to the sidewalk and parked my car.  The next morning, I saw that they had moved the cones back to the street behind my car which I had to move again to get my car out.  They definitely noticed and acted upon my LEGAL street parking, but just shrugged it off.

A week or so later, I couldn't find parking, so the same exact situation happened.  Moved the cones and parked. The next day, I simply moved the cones they placed behind my car and went about my day.

Yesterday, I had the situation happen yet again (note that this is only the 3rd time in a month that I've moved the cones to park there).  I take my dog on a walk this morning and I see a note on my windshield.  It's not even a handwritten note and printed on a paper:  THIS PLATE NUMBER HAS BEEN TURNED IN TO PARKING ENFORCEMENT.  WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO PARK IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN RESIDENCE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF YOUR NEIGHBORS.

This note pissed me off.  First of all, if you believe in consideration of your neighbors, then you shouldn't be blocking access to public parking spots where your neighbors can park.  Secondly, now you're threatening me for parking legally?  You want to start this fight? I will make you pay.

First revenge: I called parking enforcement myself and explained the situation and the lady laughed and said that my neighbors had no authority to do give me a notice like that (as I assumed).  They also gave me a number to a Bureau of Street Services investigator who can come to take a look and then issue them a citation (lucky for them that they are currently closed for the week as it's Friday afternoon, but will be calling again Monday morning).

Second revenge:  I live with my girlfriend who has her car parked in front of our house.  I moved her car in front of the house with the cones to now make it two cars they didn't want there.  Added bonus is that she has a Tesla, so there will be cameras in case they try to do anything to either of our cars.

Potential 3rd revenge:  If the citation situation doesn't happen or work out for whatever reason, I'm considering purchasing the ugliest/oldest/cheapest vehicle I can find and register it as a planned non-operational vehicle with the DMV and then keep it forever parked in front of their house.  

All things considered, I see no apparent reason why they wouldn't want to have anyone park in front of their house other than simple aesthetics.  They don't use the spots to park their own vehicles and we would never have random people wanting to park there on a regular basis.  

TLDR: Neighbor tries to keep people from street parking in front of their house by using cones, but now I just move the cones and park there, even if there are other spots closer to my home.",/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jguyyp/now_im_just_going_to_park_there_all_the_time/

1jgkqqj,edot4130,2025-03-21 16:20:56,4386,"Cautionary Tale: How sale of a 3d printer landed me in an interrogation room I had purchased a Flashforge Adventurer 3 for my son a few years back.  He has been really enjoying it and getting more advanced with his prints so we thought it was time for an upgrade.  Not having any use for the old printer I sold it on Facebook marketplace for a very low price to some teen.  We did the exchange at the local train station.  I felt really good about the whole thing believing that the printer was in the hands of some industrious young kid looking to learn a new skill set, turns out I was half right.

Fast forward two weeks and my wife gets a call from a detective in a neighboring town looking for me.  I was asked to come down and deliver a statement based on the transaction.  I looked up the marketplace profile of the kid I sold it to and saw that he relisted the printer for double the price so my assumption was that he tried to run some sort of scam and got caught.

The following day I find myself in an interrogation room speaking to a detective.  It turns out the kid was trying to print firearms (or firearm components).  Thankfully his mother had caught him and turned him into the police.  A few minutes into the interview, the line of quesitoning switched towards the specific device and what was sold.  It became clear to me that the kids story was that I sold him this printer with the designs on it and he had just printed them to see what it was, keep in mind this belonged to my YOUNG child and all that was really on there were some custom designs and figures/toys.

As far as I know I my story appeared credible and I am off the hook for the time being but it was NOT a fun experience.  Not sure how I could have avoided this other then deleting all of the files on the machine and maybe having the buyer sign some sort of statement to that effect?  Either way, never thought an unassuming little Flashforge 3 would land me in an interrogation room.

Edit:  This took place in New Jersey which seems to be one of the only states in the US where it is illegal to print such components, unless you are licensed to do so.

Edit: Okay well, the overwhelming theme seems to be that I should have retained an attorney, just not something that crossed my mind.  Gotta say that I would approach these types of situations differently in the future.  Even though I was never really worried about being charged there was a short period of time during the interview when I was concerned with where the questions were going.",/r/3Dprinting/comments/1jgkqqj/cautionary_tale_how_sale_of_a_3d_printer_landed/

1jgolfi,soulpost,2025-03-21 19:00:43,1462,"Scientists discovered a third state of being that exists between life and death - and it suggests that our cells are conscious Experts found a third state exists between life and death, where cells exhibit unexpected activity even after an organism has died.

Instead of shutting down immediately, some cells continue to function, repair themselves, and even adapt in ways that challenge our understanding of biological consciousness.

In fact, certain cells ‚Äì when provided with nutrients, oxygen, and bioelectricity ‚Äì have the capacity to transform into multicellular organisms with new functions after death.

This discovery raises fascinating questions about whether individual cells might possess a form of awareness, independent of the body as a whole.

If cells can persist and respond after death, it could redefine our perception of consciousness at a microscopic level. Some researchers argue that this cellular resilience hints at a deeper, more fundamental form of biological intelligence.

While the idea remains controversial, it opens doors for new insights into medicine, organ transplantation, and even the nature of life itself.

Could this ""third state"" mean that parts of us remain alive long after we‚Äôre gone? The implications are both profound and mysterious, offering a fresh perspective on what it truly means to be alive.",/r/HotScienceNews/comments/1jgolfi/scientists_discovered_a_third_state_of_being_that/

However, I bought this current M1 for ¬£500 ($650) last Christmas as a present to myself.

Since that day, I've been in love with this laptop, it's absolutely incredible. 

I know the M4 has just been released, and that you're probably wanting the latest and greatest (am I too lol). But please make no mistake, the M1 (8GB) is still fantastic for the normal, average, everyday user.

The trackpad, keyboard, screen, back lighting, speakers and battery are all amazing, you don't need to worry about them, I promise.

The vast majority of people aren't video editing at 4k, the vast majority simply want a stable laptop that can play movies, TV shows and YouTube without problems, aswell as having fantastic speakers to enhance all of it.

It should go without saying the M2 or M3 are better (duh!), but I promise that you won't regret the M1 if money is tight.

In all honesty, I'm looking forward to this laptop getting slow, as I'll have a reason to upgrade in the future lol.",/r/macbookair/comments/1jgwbj2/macbook_air_m1_is_still_a_great_machine_in_2025/

1jgryhy,TheLastCoagulant,2025-03-21 21:23:20,919,"This game needs not just a fog of war, but a fog of EVERYTHING. Notice this game is only exciting when there‚Äôs some level of uncertainty involved. Battles are only fun when there‚Äôs a good chance of losing. 

There‚Äôs too much certainty in this game. 

Seeing exact breakdowns of every kingdom‚Äôs military by unit. Seeing the exact traits of every marriage candidate on the medieval tinder app down to genetic traits. Seeing the personality traits of everyone on the planet so that you know not to trust the deceitful evil opportunist.  Seeing the exact percentage probability of the plot to KILL YOU. Appointing the most qualified experts in the kingdom to your council because you can see everyone‚Äôs exact skills. The player shouldn‚Äôt be omniscient. 

Everyone‚Äôs skills and traits should be hidden. You should have to learn them by interacting with them in relevant ways. You wouldn‚Äôt know that someone is deceitful unless they betray you. You wouldn‚Äôt know someone is impatient or craven unless they demonstrate it, etc. You would automatically learn the traits/skills of your close family. And even then, other people‚Äôs skills should never display an exact number, just terrible/poor/average/good/excellent. 

Marriage should operate on actual socialization. As a count or duke you should have to mingle with noble families in your area to find marriage candidates. You wouldn‚Äôt know their skills or traits beyond comely or homely. Just like in real life the marriage would be based on political alliance and family stature. Instead of now where you magically know that a 16 year old peasant girl from a different country is a genius and mastermind philosopher. 

I would take this further and have a speed of information too. Messages from other rulers (even calls to war) and information about events in neighboring kingdoms should take time to reach you depending on distance. 

If you ride out with your troops to war in a foreign land, you shouldn‚Äôt know anything happening back home. You shouldn‚Äôt know if your wife or children are still alive. 

We should only know as much as our player character knows. ",/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1jgryhy/this_game_needs_not_just_a_fog_of_war_but_a_fog/

The termination of their work permits and deportation protections under an immigration authority known as parole will take effect in late April, 30 days after March 25, according to a notice posted by the federal government.

The move will affect immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration program, known as CHNV, that was designed to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border by giving would-be migrants legal migration avenues.

A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally.

Deltarune Chapters 3 & 4 are nothing more than an elaborate psyop designed by Toby ‚ÄúUndertale‚Äù Fox to rot the brains of the masses and drain our wallets. Use your brains Deltagoons‚Äîwhy would a ‚Äúgame developer‚Äù drop a quarter of a project as bait and then release periodic updates culminating in a steam sale, followed by radio silence? Because game development is a long, complicated process and the Deltarune team cares deeply for its fanbase, wanting nothing more than for us to merely be patient and stop reposting painfully stale memes on reddit? HA! What foolish clowns you are. ALL OF YOU! Deltarune is a postmodern treatise on the promise of social progress in a world where the future has been cancelled. Chapters 3 and 4 will never come, just like the egalitarian post-greed economy the elite have vacuously promised us. By enrapturing our eyes with a diaspora of images, hypnotizing us by producing an ever-expanding spectacle of simulacra, Toby has made us blind to the actual reality he so desperately tries to hide. This is nothing more than a radical mimicry of the forms of a broken system, a double-edged denial of the expectations of an increasingly insane fandom. The Deltarune progress updates spanning the last four years have been an elaborate scam intended to catapult our minds into deeper, yet deeper stages of brainrot and take advantage of that collective psychosis to maximize Undertale revenue, and I am TIRED of pretending it‚Äôs not. Only by accepting that nothing ever happens‚Äîthat it is truly Delta-over‚Äîcan we ever hope to liberate the hearts and souls of Deltagoons everywhere.

My sister is in college, wanted to become a lawyer which I a great choice. She lives with our parents, but she does have to live under their rules or else she will be kicked out. She‚Äôs a freshman and has been doing good but it took a downside when she met her boyfriend, ever since he came into the picture she changed.



He‚Äôs a junior, my sister talks about him like he‚Äôs a god. I kinda knew stuff was going to turn out back when my sister started ditching her studies to go out with her boyfriend and his friends, my mom had to call late at night complaining about it. My parents basically spent all their money for my sister to get into her college to succeed in life but it‚Äôs not turning out how they want it to.


The thing is that my parents want my sister out because they made it clear from the beginning that they didn‚Äôt want a baby living in their home, they didn‚Äôt think my sister will finish her studies since she has this new responsibility. My parents want my sister to live with her boyfriend but it seems like his parent has the same rule. 

It‚Äôs crazy because when stuff like this happens, people dump it on me and don‚Äôt care how I feel about it. I‚Äôm just used for everyone, I could never catch a break. My sister called with the same story as our mom, she told me she needs a place to say and she thinks my home is the best place. I was nervous to tell her the truth but I did, I told her I can‚Äôt but I did give her a women‚Äôs shelter. She was anger and cursed me out for her doings.

My grand plan of spending his last days visiting the beach, etc, was waylaid when I realized his legs / hips / muscles wouldn‚Äôt take the trip - he would end up sore and achy the day after and that was not my goal. 

My good friend wisely said, ‚Äúhe only wants time with you.‚Äù So that‚Äôs what I did. 

In his final 5 days: 
- gave him wet cat food for breakfast (his favorite!)

- a nighttime snack on a couple days of vanilla ice cream with peanut butter on top

- this morning (his last day) I gave him a whole tin of sardines in olive oil (even loved his fishy breath!)

- dug his favorite squeaky toy out of the bin and kept it near him, bought him fresh yak cheese chews. 

- I spent last night sleeping on the couch - and pulled his favorite sleeping spot - an easy chair - over to the couch so we could sleep right next to each other (he‚Äôs been too uncomfortable to sleep on our bed lately)

- Bought a temporary fence and enclosed the front yard so we could spend evenings watching birds and flowers emerge for spring, and he could dig in the fresh mulch I‚Äôd laid in the gardens. 

- I spent his final hour laying next to him on his favorite dog bed, scratching his itchy spots as needed and breathing in his wonderful smell.

1jgr995,Notmas,2025-03-21 20:53:17,885,"What if the Guardian's defeated Omniman? I had this thought since episode 1 season 1, but held off asking until we got more information to see where the plot would go. At this point though, I feel like we have more then enough context to speculate on how things would have played out.

In the comics the Guardian's were defeated effortlessly, but in the show that was FAR from the case. Omniman barely made it out of that fight alive, and if the Guardian's were more coordinated then they very well could have won. From a writing standpoint, this change also makes why he did it all the more believable. The Guardian's would be a great asset in fighting off the Viltrum invasion, so it makes a lot of sense for Nolan to take them out in order to weaken Earth's defenses. In the comics, with them being so weak, Nolan killing them was kinda stupid, as it just put everyone on high alert for no good reason. That's beside the point though.

In this scenario, let's say that Red Rush stayed on the defence the entire fight, never giving Omniman the chance to grab him. Darkwing kept attacking from a distance, and actually decided to wear his exoskeleton to the fight instead of leaving it at home for whatever reason. Everyone works together well, and Nolan can't keep up, leading to him being beaten unconscious before he can take anyone out. How does this affect the story going forward? What does Omniman say when he wakes up? How does this change his plans?",/r/Invincible_TV/comments/1jgr995/what_if_the_guardians_defeated_omniman/

1jguxk8,LordWiki,2025-03-21 23:37:57,525,"Meet the World's Newest Celebrity Fake Vegan: Bella Ramsey Looks like we have another one friends. Less than two minutes into [their recent video with British Vogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJtXPm01Mdc&t), Bella Ramsey (of *Game of Thrones* and *The Last of Us* fame) drops this banger:

>""I'm supposedly vegan, but I do now eat eggs. I have a reason. I'm allergic to peas, and pea protein is like the staple protein source for vegans, and I can't eat that, and I just don't really get any protein otherwise. So eggs are good for me, so there's always eggs in my fridge.""

They also use honey in the recipe.

I don't need to say it, but this is obviously an unbelievably feeble excuse for renouncing veganism and returning to supporting animal commodification, and all of the cruelty that goes with that. The implication that pea protein is the only, or even primary, protein source for vegans, and that they just can't get protein without adding animal products, is grossly misinformed at best, and intentionally dishonest at worst.

I've learned at this point to have no faith in celebrities who claim to be vegan, largely because many of them are just nonsense plant-based fad dieters, but I feel deeply disappointed with Bella Ramsey here. I believed a lot more in Bella's veganism because they've been an outspoken advocate for animal liberation in the past and they did a [wonderful collaboration with Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRyKX5WPTfY) last year. Somehow, a part of me felt that we finally had a real activist representing veganism among our celebrities. I guess the lesson here is that no matter who, no matter what kind of work they've done, it's never a good idea to have faith in a vegan celebrity.",/r/vegan/comments/1jguxk8/meet_the_worlds_newest_celebrity_fake_vegan_bella/

&#x200B;

**My(33F) Husband(36M) may have cheated on me with my dead best friend, and had an affair baby?**

&#x200B;

I don't even know where to start! The past six months have been an absolute cluster fuck, and it only seems to be getting worse.

My best friend since elementary school, who I'll call Alice, passed away in February from cancer. She had a 2 year old daughter who went into the custody of her mom after she passed away, who I'll call Alexis.

Last month Alexis showed up on our doorstep unannounced, telling my husband he needs to take responsibility for his child and either take custody or start finally paying child support.

She says that Alice had told her when her daughter was born who the father was, but didn't want anything to do with him.

To answer the inevitable, Alice was a traveling nurse and made a lot of money which is the only reason I can think of for why she didn't go for child support.

During this conversation my husband had the worst panic attack he's ever had, so we had to end the conversation before I could get more details.

My husband's story is...I don't even know

He said that Alice's daughter is probably his, but that it isn't what I think.

Almost 3 years ago we threw a large housewarming party as we'd just moved into our dream home, after I finally finished residency and was set to make real money for once.

Alice was in town, and set to be at the party, but I was called into work before she got there. I didn't get back till after 3 am, party was winding down, my husband was passed out upstairs, and Alice had already left the party, which at the time I did find strange as we hadn't seen each other in months.

My husband claims he woke up in the middle of the night to Alice on top of him, but he passed out again before he could say anything.

He claims he never told me because he was worried I wouldn't believe him(which I don't know if I do?)

He showed me some texts he sent his best friend the next day asking for his advice about him thinking 'someone' raped him, but if he cheated he could have had that conversation as evidence, especially since he never said Alice specifically.

Ever since the party he has been very distant with Alice, and after she had her daughter he would even find excuses not to be around the house when she would visit at all. I don't know if that's because he cheated, or if Alice did actually rape him and this was his trauma response?

Honestly reddit I don't know what to do.

I've known Alice since we were children and she had never come across as that kind of person.

But I've also known my husband for over a decade and he's not once ever given the inclination of a cheater! He's an attractive guy and I've seen the looks he gets at the gym and he's never even given more than a glance.

What the hell should I do? How do I figure out what the truth is here when Alice isn't even around to defend herself? She never even implied she liked my husband, let alone want to sleep with him.

I told my husband he needs to get a DNA test before anything is decided on the childs part, but in the mean time he needs to move out while I think about what I'M going to do here.

TL;DR: Husband maybe has an affair baby, he claims he was raped by my dead best friend.

**BrilliantEmphasis862**

*Wow OP that is a mess. paternity test for sure. The old text the next day sealed it for me, I think your friend took advantage of your husband.*

&#x200B;

**Arcades**

*There are a lot of comments suggesting a DNA test, but I think you and your husband should consider talking to a family law lawyer first to determine what may happen if the DNA establishes paternity. In all likelihood, his name is not on the birth certificate if Alice was hiding this encounter. I also don't know how your jurisdiction handles parental obligations in situations of rape.*

*Your husband does not seem to be fighting the possibility, so a DNA test won't necessarily solve your marital issues and it may expose him to responsibility (financial and otherwise) that he clearly has not wanted for the last 2 years.*

&#x200B;

**Dominant\_Genes**

*His reaction screams trauma response to me. Not being believed is a victims worst nightmare. It‚Äôs hard to be rational with these types of events, but could she have slipped him something? Did she have a history of one night stands? Could they have been extra chummy because you weren‚Äôt there and they were drinking? I find it odd she specifically asked about him the first time the baby was over and that she didn‚Äôt approve of him, on what basis? Edit: Lawyer up and THEN Paternity test. Can you have a calm and collected conversation with your spouse that you want to believe him but you‚Äôre also a mess emotionally and that you need a mediator together (therapist)?*

But mostly lawyer up NOW.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this.

**Update in the post after reading the comments.**

&#x200B;

After talking with you, I've come to the realization that my husband is being truthful. My best friend raped him.

Several people pointed out that with Alice not liking my husband, if it was an affair, she would have told me when she was dying, if only to separate us.

You're absolutely right. I was there, in the room while she passed. I held her hands for days, we talked about so much. If it was just an affair, she would have told me.

But if she raped my husband, she wouldn't have said a word. That's the type of thing horrible people take to the grave.

I've also come to the realization that I made a terrible mistake asking my husband to leave for a few days while I gather my thoughts.

Not to make excuses, but losing my best friend to cancer, a long cancer fight at that, was brutal. To say that I was devastated... wouldn't do it justice. That it happened only 6 months ago, I'm still feeling it every day.

So to have this thrown on me? It's like I'm losing her all over again. Either she betrayed me, and fucked my husband. Or she betrayed me and raped my husband.

Not only have I lost her, but now I've lost the good memories, an entire lifetimes worth.

It was impossible for me to look at him and not also see her, and be struck with the horror and realization of that loss all over again. I felt I needed to be able to breakdown, grieve, and think without the fresh wave of loss I got every time I saw him.

It was wrong of me to ask him to leave, you're right though, and as of a few minutes ago I've righted this wrong. I called my husband, I apologized, told him I believe him, and begged him to come home. He'll be here in half an hour at most, and I'm going to support my husband the way I know he would have supported me.

I've been an off and on reddit user for several years, and sometimes the advice given on subreddits like these can be a bit hit or miss...but today you guys did good.

You've helped me realize not only that I was wrong, and being stupid at that, but that I was hurting the person that needed me the most. I was selfish.

I have no idea what we're going to do as far as the potential daughter is concerned, but I can assure you we'll deal with it together.

It's going to take a lot of time, and probably alot of therapy, to grieve this new loss. I feel numb now, as though I'll never cry again.

My best friend raped my husband, which means she was no friend of mine. She flaunted it, coming to my house, sitting with me, and gabbing. She brought her child here, trying to rub it in his face, right in front of me. She tortured the man I loved, and I was an unknowing party to it. I feel sick to my stomach over how many times she came over, just to hold it over him.

I'm honestly at a loss on how to make that up to him. If you all have any ideas, please feel free to give them to me, I think I'll need all the help I can get.

Tomorrow I'm going to take a leave of absence from work, just until we can figure out our next steps, and we can get our heads on straight.

Thank you everyone

**Update - 7 months later**

&#x200B;

I've received a lot of messages asking for an update, so I've decided to finally sit down and write one out. As you can imagine, after the cluster fuck that was thrust upon us, this update isn't likely to answer any of your questions, only present a few more.

I want to start by telling you all that I love, and trust my husband. My reaction to ask him for space to think, in retrospect, was wrong...but at the time I didn't know what to think. It was a combination of losing my best friend again, and also the fear that I was losing my husband, that sent me spiralling.

Again, it was a mistake to ask him to leave, and I did rectify that in the end.

Now, for the update.

As mentioned in the original post, I did take a leave of absence from work and we spent a long time just being together. Talking, reaffirming our love for one another, and figuring out what to do next.

We of course spoke with a lawyer, and my husband was very adamant about not having anything to do with the child, but was willing to offer financial support as needed.

So we agreed to do a DNA test immediately to prove paternity, and then go from there. Didn't know you could buy tests on Amazon, but with only a few weeks processing it was the easiest path forward since Alexis lives hours away.

To everyone's surprise, Alice's daughter is not my husband. We ended up testing twice, both very, very definitive.

The first test we performed ourselves as mentioned, and another after Alexis refused to believe the first test, and took my husband to court for child support.

For a single second this whole thing made me second guess if my husband was raped; that this could have been her way of forcing my husband to admit to an affair...but after talking with Alexis, I don't think that was the plan.

Alexis says that Alice told her my husband was the father under strict confidence, demanding that she never, ever tell me or my husband. We were only ever to be told if Alexis died before Alice's daughter was old enough to take care of herself, so that she wouldn't end up in foster care.

The only reason Alexis came to us then, instead of keeping that secret, is because Alice's life insurance wasn't being released yet, and she was out of options. She also felt I should know my husband and her daughter had had an ""affair"".

This all reaffirms in my mind that Alice did rape my husband, with the expectation of getting pregnant with his child. She obviously had other partners at the time, since one of them fathered her daughter, but no one knows who. It's clear to me that Alice believed it was my husband.

I did suggest Alexis upload a sample to Ancestry, see if any matches pop up, but as Alice traveled all over for work, I don't know that anything will ever come of that. In truth, I've washed my hands of the situation. Alice did enough damage, and I don't particularly plan to be around for any more.

My husband and I have gone through a lot of counseling, and will likely continue for a while. This whole situation damaged us both, my husband more obviously, and I don't think we'll fully heal for a very long while.

To answer a few questions;

No, sadly there isn't a hidden diary, or texts to explain what the fuck was going on.

My husband and I are not getting divorced. He understands why I reacted the way I did, and has been strong when I was weak before. I've spent the past 7 months being strong while he was weak, so we're considering the whole thing even. We are still madly in love, and plan to be together for a long time still(more on this!!).

No, we will not be adopting Alice's child. If she had been my husbands, we would not have been adopting the child.

Ultimately I thank reddit for setting me straight. There was a massive outpouring of support, and corrective advice; to say I got a slap in the face would be a descriptive but apt way to put it. I needed it then, and I thank you for it.

To say that you may have saved my marriage is an understatement.

I do however, have some good news!

During my leave of absence, while my husband and I rediscovered what makes us love eachother the most...I got pregnant. We're expecting our first baby, a girl, in a little over 3 months, and my husband and I are ecstatic!

And no, we will not be naming her after my dead ex best friend.

TL;DR: Not my husbands baby, not our problem. No answers, just questions, and oh, I'm having a baby!

*I'm willing to bet she was jealous of your life, and for a minute...wanted to know what it felt like to be you. So she waited for your husband to be in a vulnerable position, intoxicated and passed out and took her shot. She probably had random partners to either make her feel less guilty about raping him, or to try and get pregnant and really take a shot at him making him believe her kid was his and maybe he'd kick you out and move her in. She probably told her mom it was your husband's child to save face and not have to say she didn't actually know. She probably figured no dna test would be done, but even if it was...she wouldn't be here for the fall-out. She truly was a shitty human being. I'm so happy for you both that it's not his child. It's bad enough she raped him...but to have to deal with a child on top of it would be horrible. Enjoy your little one, hopefully you can all put this behind you now.*

- I‚Äôm sick of how American media exploits pretty young women who go missing 

- I resent that only white women get this attention 

- I felt like I already lived through the story as it happened in real time, why do I need to watch a show about it?

I‚Äôm really glad I watched it now. It was a good reminder not just for myself but as a person with women friends and family members, to not dismiss bad behavior from men. 

I believe this series will help many women realize they need to leave a bad relationship, and will prevent many women from entering long term relationships that could end up dangerous.

One of the most enlightening parts was the cop body cam footage from Utah. You get a really good glimpse into how woefully unprepared and untrained cops are when it comes to domestic violence. 

I no longer see her story as one of exploitation but rather a powerful message that every woman needs to hear. 

Even if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll ever be in this situation, you may end up knowing someone who is. If I had teenage daughters, I would insist they watch this to understand how abusive relationships can look. 

Please watch, please encourage women to watch.

so i created a fake id, let's name it Z, and texted him, he started flirting with her (he had never ever flirted with me so this was super weird). he immediately started saying stuff like he would come to Z's place (same place as mine btw). in simple words, he was down bad. then he told Z that i was from the same place as her and she told him that she wants to talk to me (what tf was i on..) and then i was simultaneously texting and replying to myself while sending him the screenshots. üò≠

Z was getting possessive of him so she told me that she didnt want me texting him, i told bro abt how crazy Z was for him and it made him like her more (say sike rn). he asked me to tell her that i stopped texting him. i pretended to be mad at him while Z kept flirting. Z asked him if he liked her more than me and mfer chose her. Z texted me abt this and i screenshotted this and sent it to him which made him apologize üò≠üò≠

finally i got bored of being Z too, so i thought that i should end it. Z revealed that her bf saw his texts and got super mad. now bro came back to me whining that she didnt tell him that she had a bf beforehand. he then asked me to text her from my side cause she had blocked him. so began the self beef, i was cussing myself out from both ends but i kinda made Z dumb in the process. i told Z to fuck off and she got pissed at the end and blocked me. lastly i got my offline friends in this beef too. i made them text Z and cussed them out as well.üíÄ

none of them know that the bitchy person they beefed with was me and i dont think i can ever tell them. i just really wanted to share this with someone.",/r/confession/comments/1jgl99a/18f_got_so_bored_once_i_made_a_fake_account_to/

--

Long version- I work as an SDR (sales dev rep). Been doing it for years. Cold Calling ,emailing, reaching out, etc. Easy work, but shit pay. Salaries usually start between 40k-60k and year ""plus comission"". 

Sales culture sucks. It's usually contrived of leaders who're in over their heads with VC and stakeholder pressure and they usually take it out on some poor underpaid junior sales rep or SDR. 

I used to be the type of rep who'd feel bad and take it all laying down while trying to think about ways I could improve the system for my masters. SDRs are at the center of the blame game for low quota attainment.

But, ever since I started OEing, that stress is GONE baby! I do my job, and nothing more.

Had a meeting with the boss today, same old shit.
*The sales team isn't hitting their numbers
*I need to book more meetings (as if it's my fault that people don't like being interrupted on their personal cell) 
*Not going to hit bonus (no one does lol)

I just sat there, nodding, didn't have much to say back.  The look my manager gave me when he realized that nothing he was saying to me was hurting, was frankly incredible and I'd pay to re live that moment. 

Even if I got fired tomorrow, I could go find work doing the same shit within 48 hours. 

Current OE status: 3 SDR jobs, 160k-180k per year. Comfy life in the midwest, cheap living, money goes far.",/r/overemployed/comments/1jgrq90/oe_gives_me_a_weird_sense_of_power_over_my_bosses/

# The Facts

* Longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber on Wednesday publicly called for Elon Musk to step down as Chief Executive Officer, citing Musk's divided attention between Tesla and his role in the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a special adviser in the Trump administration.
* In an interview, Gerber said Tesla is ""absolutely"" in crisis and has been ""neglected for too long."" He added, ""It's time for somebody to run Tesla.""
* Tesla's market value has decreased by more than $800B since December, with shares down over 50% from their peak. The electric vehicle maker is facing declining sales and increasing competition in key markets.
* In addition, the company is experiencing a nationwide boycott in reaction to Musk's actions with the administration. There have been incidents of vandalism at showrooms and charging stations, including Molotov cocktail attacks in Las Vegas and gunshots fired at facilities in Portland.
* Previously, Gerber's wealth management firm, which owned 262,352 Tesla shares as of February, began selling shares in 2023 as concerns mounted over Musk's leadership and Tesla's declining reputation.
* Multiple Tesla executives have sold over $100M worth of shares since early February, including James Murdoch's $13M sale and Kimbal Musk's ‚Äî Elon Musk's brother ‚Äî disposal of 75K shares worth approximately $27M.",/r/stocks/comments/1jgl0wc/top_tesla_investor_demands_musks_exit_amid_stock/

We planned to do a day in Anaheim and visit Downtown Disney (we are broke college students that could DEFINITELY not afford tickets).While in Downtown Disney, a person stopped us and asked if we had tickets to the park, and we told him no. He asked if we wanted two park-hopper tickets for the day for free! I immediately said yes and thanked him no less than 100 times. Turns out he was an employee that had reserved tickets for friends, but they bailed last minute and he did not want to those tickets to go to waste. This was my first trip to Disneyland and I have always been fascinated by the history of the park. The trip was so magical, and we were able to ride 15 rides between the two parks (we did end up buying the multi pass which helped so much).

1jgjk6y,CarrotEyebrows,2025-03-21 15:31:23,1935,"Making cards This is the way I like to make proxies. 

After printing, I laminate my sheets.
Then I cut them out with my cutting machine.
Then I put the cards through the laminator a second time.

I use 110 lb cardstock and 3 mil lamination sheets. Because they‚Äôre laminated, I don‚Äôt put them in sleeves and they shuffle very nicely. It feels great to riffle shuffle Magic cards. Also because they‚Äôre laminated, they‚Äôre dry erase too. I have a bunch of blanks and people can make their own lands and shuffle them into their decks.

My cutting machine is the Cameo 5. I highly recommend it. Because I print with registration marks, it cuts very accurately. All the cards are exactly the same size and perfectly centered. It also does the rounded corners for me.

It costs me around 1.8 cents per card. I mainly use the method to play cube. I‚Äôve made 8 360-card cubes so far. 2880 cards * 1.8 cents = $51.84. The cutting machine is around $300 and the laminator is $20.

My only complaint is it‚Äôs not a fast process. It probably takes me around 2 hours to finish cutting and laminating a cube but I think it‚Äôs worth the time and the savings are great!",/r/magicproxies/comments/1jgjk6y/making_cards/

1jgrvph,Enough_Path2929,2025-03-21 21:19:54,641,"Friendly Reminder! Clean your console! It's really easy. And really important. Just cleaned mine for the first time after overcoming much trepidation about attempting it. My console had quite a bit of dust along the outside vents. Enough to really demand further evaluation.

I was nervous about attempting to clean out my console, but far more nervous about so much dust building up inside these vents. Even worse, inside the console and ruining it. Weighing my options, it was time.

I found a great 3 minute video on how to open the outside casing shell pieces. They were very easy to pop off, and pop back on. I opened them 1 side at a time and very gently and meticulously alternated between poking, wiping, and dabbing up any clusters of dust from along the inside portion of vents and from along the fan casing. Using a small screw driver to poke and scrape. Then a wet wipe to very gently dab up the filth. Making sure not to poke any gunk deeper into the console. With little effort, and a slow, steady pace, I was able to very successfully clean out everything. My PS5 is now clean as a whistle and functions 100% efficiently.

Each side took me about 10-15 minutes. Will probably only take me about 5-7 next time I have to do it.

This is my reminder and also a message of encouragement to clean out your beautiful PS5 console and don't let it get too caked with dust.

After that, I would come back every few months to catch up on all the updates, and drop the series again. I noticed the first hundred chapters bring removed to be taken to Amazon, and thought nothing of it- this is common for original fiction on RR. I caught up to what chapters were avaliable sometime in 2023, dropped it to let a backlog build up and just. Sorta forgot about it.

Now, two years later, I saw a tweet by a YouTuber about 'Dungeon Crawler Carl', and was like 'wait, that thing on RR? I swear it got dropped or something?' And I looked back into it and my god. Actual paperbacks? Audiobooks? Topping bestseller lists? A TV ADAPTATION??????? I never could have imagined that this litRPG series, among so many hundreds of others online, would ever grow to this level of incredible success. It is absolutely incredible, and well deserved!! Kinda wish that an announcement post or something was made on RR but it's clear that this series has outgrown that.

Anyway, just wanted to make a post gushing about this story absolutely making my day. If you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy the entire series...",/r/DungeonCrawlerCarl/comments/1jgvr38/holy_shit_what_happened_to_this_series/

Hiking at night through bear country was a bit daunting at first, but the serenity and peace under the stars made it all worthwhile. Experiencing the Morning Glory Pool, usually bustling with visitors, in total solitude was surreal. This incredible view of the Milky Way over such an iconic spot definitely calls for another nighttime adventure to soak in Yellowstone‚Äôs beauty after dark.

But there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve never been able to do: finish the final season. Every time I get to it, I just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs gut-wrenching, and I‚Äôve always known the ending is going to break me. I‚Äôve watched every episode over and over, but that last season? It‚Äôs just too heavy.  

Mrs. McCluskey‚Äôs death. No big speech, no drawn-out farewell‚Äîjust her, sitting in that chair, slipping away while ‚ÄúWonderful! Wonderful!‚Äù played. Outside, life went on- Renee‚Äôs wedding, laughter, music- while inside, she was gone. Quiet. Final. Absolutely gut-wrenching.  

And looking back, it feels like we weren‚Äôt just saying goodbye to McCluskey. We were saying goodbye to Kathryn Joosten. A woman who brought so much heart and soul to that role, and who, in a way, slipped away just like her character did.

My daughter got pregnant and they asked if I could take Koda bc they were afraid he would be ‚Äútoo much‚Äù with the baby. I happily took him in and it is just me, him and my cat. 

My whole life (42) everyone has told me how I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. Too much talking, too much energy, taking up too much space. So, as silly as it sounds, I related with the shoob and turns out we were meant for each other. For all the situations we have to tone down, we are never ‚Äútoo much‚Äù with each other. He could never be too much for me and I‚Äôm never too much for him. I didn‚Äôt want him to be rejected from anyone else for his personality so I have made sure I do whatever I can to help him. 

I recently lost everything, literally everything, but I have my cat and of course the shoob. In this dark dark time he is the only thing who gets me out of bed, and forces me to touch grass and be present. He makes sure I am loved. So I will do everything I can to make sure he has everything he needs and wants. I‚Äôll definitely make sure he never feels like he‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù bc I‚Äôve never been ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for him. I‚Äôll always love him for that alone. ü´∂üèªüò≠

P.S. turns out he is the most gentle and kind animal to the baby. I admit I was even surprised about how calm he is with her. She actually exclusively only laughs at him. ‚ù§Ô∏è

After a slow start, I eventually moved and picked up a 5lber just off the bank. Shot my friend a text to join me, and a few minutes later I hooked into a really heavy one. That ended up smashing my old PB of 6.56lbs that held for 7 years at 8.00lbs (second photo)! After releasing this fish and texting some photos, I picked up the rod again and made another cast. Immediately felt a fish, swung, and knew it was a fish of the same caliber. After grabbing it I couldn't believe what I was looking at, and knew it was in the conversation for being a 10+. On two different scales this fish weighed 9.31lbs, and was 23.25""x20.5"" (first photo). Only gone fishing a handful of times since late February, and it's already the best prespawn I've ever had for big fish.

1jgvzi3,KJWeb8,2025-03-22 00:28:12,544,"We must stop for lunch? Ok. A company I used to work for, a for hire dump truck company, usually rented our trucks out by the hour. We had a no lunch policy to the customer. Our clock stayed running even if the customer took lunch. Most customers planned it so we were in transit during lunch.

One time, we had a customer insist we take a half hour lunch, unpaid to the trucks. We had enough trucks on it that the boss said ok. He also told us that if they wanted us to move from 12-12:30, they had to sign our timesheet with no lunch and the time. Game on. 

The first day, right before 12, I backed in to be loaded. Operator gets out, walks over, and tells me lunch time with a huge grin (our policy was well known and well hatedü§∑). I asked if he was going to sign for no lunch. He said no, with a puzzled look. I said ok, and started to pull away. He stopped me and asked where I was going. I said lunch. He said I was already backed in. I told him to either sign no lunch, or I was going. He waved me off.

I went around the block to a local beef joint, got my sandwich, and drove back. I parked out front, and the operator waved me to back in. I just pointed at my watch and waited for 12:30 to back in. The operator came over and asked why none of the other trucks were back yet. I told him if our hard stop at 12:00 rule. He looked a little defeated.

Two days later, the lunch break rule was rescinded.",/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1jgvzi3/we_must_stop_for_lunch_ok/

1jgmybg,LordHamSammich,2025-03-21 17:51:47,1073,"A thank you from someone who was ready to hate the game. I was wrong, and I‚Äôll admit it.

I came into this game expecting to hate it, but honestly, it‚Äôs fixed a lot of what I‚Äôve wanted in the series from the beginning. Non-lethal takedowns? Finally i can stay my blade from the flesh of the innocent. I‚Äôve always felt that soldiers and guards are just doing a job, so having that option means a lot. They have no idea about the whole Isu/Templar deep lore, and are just protecting property or people 9 times out of 10.

Then there‚Äôs the ability to unequip the armory‚Äôs worth of weapons strapped to your body. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the Assassin? Maybe that guy with four swords, a shield, a spear, and full plate armor standing in the dark‚Ä¶‚Äù That‚Äôs gone, and now we can actually blend in with proper outfits.

And the music, I thought the modern twist was going to be jarring, but it actually blends in perfectly, adding to the ambience and energy in a way I didn‚Äôt expect.

I could go on and on, but I just hope someone at Ubisoft sees this and knows they proved me wrong. I have egg on my face and don‚Äôt deserve the good time I‚Äôm having.

SRV spent all afternoon in his room, playing music and just making this day very special to a very sick boy, whose dream was to meet him.
His parents were very good friends of mine, and and they lost their son not long after this pic was taken.
SRV left 2 one hundred dollar bills under his pillow and traded hats with him.

To the interviewer, it‚Äôs as obvious as daylight when someone uses ChatGPT. Here are some very obvious signals:

1. Coderpad warns the interviewer if you select and copy the text. It also warns the interviewer whenever you‚Äôre off of Coderpad. These items get recorded and it becomes an immediate reject. 

2. As an interviewer, I can see your eyes darting from one screen to the next as you‚Äôre writing the code. It‚Äôs a very, very obvious when it happens. 

3. 99% of the time when someone copies their answer, they are unable to walk through their code with even a basic test case. And if they are able to walk through with a basic test case, I just ask them one edge case and the whole thing falls apart. 

4. Furthermore, when we write our feedback, we have to mention that you‚Äôve used outside resources, which will most likely get you blacklisted. 

If you‚Äôre unable to answer the questions, it‚Äôs perfectly fine. Use it as a learning opportunity. Your resume and experience is already good enough to get you an interview. If you do okay and get rejected by a small margin, you will get a call back after 6 months. If you‚Äôre caught cheating, you‚Äôre never going to get a call back. 

Edit: For all those who are questioning why Leetcode style interviews suck, let me tell you something, your opinion on this matter at this time is irrelevant. I‚Äôm not in a position of authority to change this and neither are you. This is a game that you have to play. Either you get good at the game or you don‚Äôt. All I‚Äôm trying to say is, cheating in this fashion will get you quickly disqualified from the game. ",/r/leetcode/comments/1jgn7k4/please_please_dont_cheat_using_chatgpt_for_your/

1jgljwj,HauntedAlgorithm,2025-03-21 16:54:47,1232,"How I got my frozen bank account unfreezed So, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people struggling to unfreeze their bank accounts after cyber crime complaints, especially those dealing with P2P transactions or random small credits. I went through this nightmare twice and learned exactly how to deal with it. 

8 months ago, my ICICI Bank account was debit freezed because I received a ‚Çπ175 credit in Layer 3. The bank got an email from cyber police station, and the entire account was locked. I had ‚Çπ18.6 lakhs stuck inside.  
  
I went to the bank, and they gave me the standard ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do anything‚Äù response. They handed me a letter saying ""Cyber police told us to freeze it."" When I asked for a copy of the email or notice, they refused.

The investigating officer wouldn‚Äôt pick up calls or respond to emails. And I wasn‚Äôt going to travel 2,200 km just for this.  

So, I tagged the district and state police handles on Twitter (X). Within a day, the officer called me but said I had to come in person.  

Now, personally, I don‚Äôt like dealing with cops. I knew they‚Äôd talk nonsense, and if I responded, things could escalate. So, I refused to go.  

Since the cops weren‚Äôt helping, I went straight to the High Court and filed a Writ Petition.  

The court ruled:  

Only the disputed amount can be frozen, not the entire account.
Freezing my entire account was illegal (based on a similar case in the Madras High Court - W.P. No. 25631 of 2024).  

The court ordered ICICI Bank to hold just ‚Çπ175 and unfreeze the rest. After 8 months, I finally got my money back.  

Right after I got my ICICI account back, my Federal Bank account was frozen due to another random small Layer 4 credit.

This time, I didn‚Äôt even recognize the transaction, but apparently, some complaint was filed somewhere, and without any warning, my entire account got debit freezed.  

Now I know what to do.

Step 1: Checking Why My Account Was Frozen
I asked the bank:

Did the police send the notice under Section 91 CrPC or Section 102 CrPC?

Here‚Äôs why this matters:  
Section 91 CrPC:  Police can‚Äôt freeze your account, they can only ask for details.  

Section 102 CrPC: Police can order freeze, but they must inform a magistrate within 2 months.

In my case, the police never informed the magistrate, making the freeze illegal.
  
I told the bank:  

This freeze doesn‚Äôt comply with the law. 
As per the High Court ruling, they can only freeze the disputed amount, not my entire account.  
They never informed me or provided a copy of the freeze notice.  

The bank still refused to unfreeze it.

I made it clear:  

I would file a High Court case against them.  
They were violating High Court guidelines.  
If I took them to consumer court, it would get ugly.  

Suddenly, the bank manager changed his tone and asked for proof that I wasn‚Äôt involved in any fraud.  

I instantly filed an RTI (costs 10 rupees) asking:
  
Is there any case registered against me in this district or state?

The response came back NO, my name wasn‚Äôt even in any complaint.  

After showing the RTI response and threatening legal action, the bank finally unfreezed my account. They asked for an application, requesting to unfreeze with the RTI reply attached.

In similar situation, you can try these:

Ask the bank if the freeze is under:  
Section 91 CrPC or 102 CrPC, did they inform a magistrate within 2 months. If they didn't, the freeze is illegal. 

Demand Proof from the Bank. Ask for a copy of the email or letter from cyber crime, ask for a confirmation letter about the freeze and ask why they froze the entire account instead of just the disputed amount.  

File a RTI asking is there any case against you in this district or state related to that freeze. If the answer is NO, use this as proof to unfreeze your account.  

You have to put some pressure on the bank. Tell them the freeze is illegal if they didn‚Äôt follow CrPC rules. Bank's have to follow up the too in a debit freeze by police. Mention the Madras High Court judgement (W.P. No. 25631 of 2024). Warn them about filing a case in High Court and Consumer Court. 

If the police or bank ignores, post on X. This will force them to act fast. If nothing is working file a Writ Petition in High Court. Courts have already ruled that banks can‚Äôt freeze entire accounts illegally. 

Edit: Currently CrPC is replaced by BNSS. So you have to look for section 94 and 106 of BNSS instead of 91 and 102 CrPC.",/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1jgljwj/how_i_got_my_frozen_bank_account_unfreezed/

1jgsca4,Open-Coconut1565,2025-03-21 21:40:28,511,"I got back with my ex. Nothing changed. We broke up in April ‚Äò24. I spent 1 or 2 solid months chasing her until she made it very clear I should just give up and move on. I was absolutely devastated. Pain beyond belief. Spent 2 months in complete degeneracy while in no contact. As an anxious attatcher, no contact is *incredibly* difficult for me. I indulged every vice I could just to have the pain subside. Drinking, junk food, drugs, gambling, porn, the works. Finally I decided that if she isn‚Äôt coming back it isn‚Äôt worth throwing myself down the gutter for something thats long been over. Slowly but surely, I picked myself up and dusted myself off. I went on a diet, started working out, changed my hair and clothes, deep cleaned my entire house and car, tried new hobbies, met new friends, and went out whenever I could. I was feeling great, looking great, finally starting to get over her. Still I missed her badly at times. Random bouts of crying. Dread setting in when the sun rose or set. Night after night I prayed to hear from her just once more. Every day the pain lessened, even if just a fraction of a fraction. I pushed on. Gym, hobbies, friends, family. These are the things that heal. Finally I began moving on. 

Then, 2 months ago. With less than zero expectation, I heard from her. My hundreds of prayers finally answered. Surreal is the only way I could describe it. She called saying she missed me, she made a mistake, she couldn‚Äôt handle being without me. I felt I was dreaming. Absolute and total disbelief. 

We caught up, started being friends again. It‚Äôs as if nothing changed at all. As if nothing changed. That went from being the good part to being the bad part. Slowly but surely we began annoying eachother again. Little arguments would escalate again. I began to notice all the little things that would get under my nerves about her. These things I either *completely* forgot or downplayed while we were broken up and I thought she was absolutely perfect for me. After a mere month, we broke up again.

The lesson here is that once things are over with someone they‚Äôre probably really over. Rose tinted glasses will get you to believe with your whole heart that the person was your one and only. You forget all the arguments, the nit picks, all the stupid shit that led to the break up in the first place. The only person you‚Äôll truly have for the rest of your life is *you*. Learn to love yourself. I deeply regret the time I wasted loathing in pain and vices. I don‚Äôt regret the time I spent building myself back up into the person I wanted to be. The person I didn‚Äôt pay attention to while I was in the relationship - myself.",/r/BreakUps/comments/1jgsca4/i_got_back_with_my_ex_nothing_changed/

My old girl Bella has been with me since I was young, and it‚Äôs safe to say she is my best friend. Shes made it to 15 years old, and in the past year she has started to show signs of getting up there in age. Shes a yellow lab, she‚Äôs always been on the smaller side but shes been a healthy weight for most of her life.

She has arthritis, kidney problems, she‚Äôs very very thin (you can see her bone in some places)and I believe ulcers in her stomach? In summary: not doing so good. Thing is, she is still playing, not in any pain that we can tell, eating a ton, drinking a ton, running around, etc.

The main problem that has my parents telling me ‚Äúprepare for the worst‚Äù every day is that she has lost control of her bowel movements, and she‚Äôs having diarrhea when she goes. Apparently this is a very common sign of dogs dying but I just can‚Äôt get it out of my head that she‚Äôs still happy? And other than her medical issues, she‚Äôs still her. 

Is this just me holding on to hope that she‚Äôll get better, and I‚Äôm just coping? Or does she still have some time left? What signs should I look out for? 

Side note: Normally we would go to the vet in this case but my parents don‚Äôt want to throw $100 at the vet just to get bloodwork done that will tell us what we already know‚Ä¶ usually when we call the vet, they answer our questions free of charge but I just don‚Äôt know at this point, and neither do they.

I always wanted a ML shaped guitar, since the very first time seeing dimebag play one (on youtube) :( , at first I was tempted of buying one of those Aliexpress fakes, which make no mistake: they look gorgeous. But my main concern was the playability, and some of the reviews you see on the internet said that the neck of the guitars was kinda chunky. Also considering the cost of upgrading each component, my procrastination tendencies, and the time that it requires, I opted for an original.
Finding the right offer on reverb was no candy, and importing something from America to Europe is always a pain in the ass, especially the customs fees, but in the end HERE WE ARE!!!!
The neck feel amazing, its a V shaped one but very smooth, you still feel it but its no as drastic as you could think, the whole geometry of the guitar demands you to play it more vertically while standing up, unlike others... The pickups are great, i thought of a swap with a Bill and Becky Bill Lawrence but I think I will keep em, since they sound very good. The floyd special?

1jgp4dz,Royal-Silver7080,2025-03-21 19:22:45,747,"Our disgraced ex-bishop is getting re-baptized and will be attending the ward he harmed. Years ago our bishop was caught in immoral and illegal activities while serving as bishop. He was excommunicated and served time. In the following months and years this man has showed no remorse or has made no attempts to acknowledging the spiritual harm he caused. It is clear he is a manipulative narcissist and was only sorry he was caught. We got word he will be re-baptized and it sounds like the leadership would like him to be reintegrated into our ward. 

As a woman, I do not feel safe around this predator. My activity is basically none these days, but my children attend on occasion. I care deeply about the women and children in my neighborhood and their opinions and their safety. Other women have spoken to ward and stake leadership about their concerns. We‚Äôve sent letters to the stake President and have not had any response on a stake level. 

Since deconstructing, this personal experience has highlighted the gravely problematic issues with the church. 

1. They are inequitably more lenient on men and sexual predators. 
2. They say they encourage women to speak up, but they don‚Äôt actually value their experiences or discernment. Even if 10 women come out and say they are uncomfortable, we are gaslit and told we just need to forgive, have more faith, and seek for more healing. 
3. They are terrible with boundaries. 
4. They‚Äôve got forgiveness all wrong. Forgiveness doesn‚Äôt equate to trust. Forgiveness doesn‚Äôt mean allowing sexual predators around vulnerable women and children. 
5. They‚Äôve got repentance all wrong. I guess ‚Äúhe‚Äôs taken all the steps‚Äù, to be re-baptized, which probably means daily scriptures and conference talks. Everything shy of owning up to his harm and showing any ounce of humility. 
6. Leadership, those that are supposed to be spiritual councilors, are woefully untrained and not trauma-informed. 
7. The church cannot recognize narcissists because itself is a narcissistic organization. 
8. Patriarchal men will not speak out against other men, but instead try to stay neutral. ""Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented‚Äù- Elie Wiesel. I‚Äôve noticed the benevolent patriarchy in some responses from leadership. They will actively listen to the women‚Äôs point of view, but they‚Äôll still side with the man every time, because patriarchal men are more concerned about their reputation among other men.
9. Hard and fast rules like only attending your ward in your assigned geographical area is weird and arbitrary. We are told he needs to be integrated into our ward. 

None of this would be an issue if this man had any self-awareness or humility to attend another ward, and not the ward where our trust in him was betrayed, OR if the stake leaders weren‚Äôt insistant on him attending our ward. It‚Äôs like asking someone who was abused to see their abuser on a weekly basis. It‚Äôs wrong. By not confronting his indiscretions and sweeping under the rug the harms inflicted on us just perpetuates more harm. It‚Äôs like they are saying the harm our ward experienced isn‚Äôt important enough for acknowledgment and accountability. It‚Äôs adding insult to injury. I fear they‚Äôve placed our comfort on their alter of unity. However, ‚ÄúUnity should not come at the expense of the most vulnerable. How can you become one with a person or a system who will not acknowledge or relent in their torment of you? That‚Äôs not unity; it‚Äôs annihilation.‚Äù -Cole Arthur Riley

It's almost all thrifted or handmade. The horn headband is made with real sticks, fake plants, and a little crocheted frog. The earrings are real acorns, super glued together. The sticks and acorns are sprayed with a sealant made for wood floors so they should hold up well! I think this is actually the third year for the stick horns and they've held up great.

I got the mushroom necklace from Scarborough Faire last year and it's made from a little gourd (I wish I remembered the name of the shop!)

While I appreciate the input, my approach reflects my personal needs and working style. Here‚Äôs what my vault represents for me:

* **Personal Adaptation:**
   * My brain is naturally forgetful, so I rely on an external system to capture everything from work ideas to leisure notes.
   * Research in cognitive load theory shows that offloading information can enhance productivity and reduce mental strain.
* **Holistic Organization:**
   * Instead of compartmentalizing by strict minimalism, I‚Äôve created one unified space that covers:
      1. **Work and Research:** A dedicated area for professional projects and ongoing learning.
      2. **Content Creation:** Sections for brainstorming, drafting, and refining ideas for articles and videos.
      3. **Leisure and Entertainment:** A playful corner for personal interests and inspiration.
      4. **Relationships and Business Management:** Tools to keep track of networking, collaborations, and day-to-day administrative tasks.
* **Tailored to Me:**
   * While minimalist systems work for some, I‚Äôve found that a more comprehensive and interlinked structure suits my thought process best.
   * This vault isn‚Äôt just a note-taking system‚Äîit‚Äôs a dynamic, all-in-one tool curated to fit my unique workflow.

I‚Äôm excited to share some screenshots of my vault. I hope you find inspiration in the way I‚Äôve embraced what others might call ‚Äúorganized chaos.‚Äù

1. The new director Bill Pulte (yes, of PulteHomes) has purged the board of directors of both Companies and filled them with his cronies. 

2. Bill has appointed himself as Chairman of both board of directors.

3. This week Bill has fired the CEO, DEI officer, Head of HR, Head of corporate Strategy at Freddie Mac. 

4. Pulte is mandating that both Fannie and Freddie return to office 5 days a week. 

5. On Lauren Ingram, Pulte went on Fox News on Monday blatantly lying that tax dollars were going to waste on office space for Freddie and Fannie since employees are hybrid

These institutions are under attack in a highly sensitive industry (Mortage finance). This is just the beginning and we expect there to be mass layoffs and more cronism in the near future.

Furthermore it did this to two other people in our party, every turn. Suffice to say we blitzed the thing into the ground as while 1dmg isn't a lot, the fact that it couldn't be prevented seems like some actual hacks.

This time we‚Äôll aim to fly on an A350 (lowest cabin altitude possible in a commercial airline short of a private jet) to see if that helps, with an airline that allows dogs in business class cabin. 

I have already bought ear muffs and have 3 bag options for her. The vet already cleared her for flying and prescribed a gabapentin on standby only if she really struggles during the 11 hour flight. 

The return flight is not for another month - which is also the reason why she‚Äôs having to come with - so even though it‚Äôs a work trip, she‚Äôll be able to go to the beach pretty much every day to help her recover until it‚Äôs time to come back home.

1jgpnk0,StudentCrafty2169,2025-03-21 19:45:15,610,"My bf is Muslim, I‚Äôm not, but he told me he‚Äôd leave me if i drink or smoke.. !! I posted a small update as a new post, as the comments on this one have been restricted, feel free to leave an other advice in the comments on the update !! ü§ç

For context, me and my bf have been together for over a year now. When we first met he kept asking me if i drank or smoked, at the time i did smoke multiple times a week and would drink occasionally, maybe a few times a year, but never to the point of actually being drunk. I was honest with him and told him that, and my views on such things. I told him that i believe doing anything like that excessively is definitely harmful, but that since i deal with diagnosed, major mental illnesses that smoking is helpful to me every once in a while, to help me relax and think clearly, as that‚Äôs very hard for me to do normally. He never really gave me a response, he j told me he was sober and that‚Äôs it. He never said anything abt being uncomfortable w me smoking‚Ä¶
I feel like it‚Äôs important to mention that this conversation happened abt a month into us seriously talking, though we weren‚Äôt ‚Äúofficial‚Äù yet. And at the time, he had yet to mention anything about his religion. I had no idea he was muslim. I don‚Äôt quite remember when exactly he told me, but it was after we had been on multiple dates and he j kinda went ‚Äúyeah like j so yk im muslim‚Äù.. to which i was like ‚Äúokayyy?‚Äù he told me he didn‚Äôt wanna tell me incase i had something against it, which i don‚Äôt. I was very confused abt why he wouldn‚Äôt tell me, and why he thought i would dislike him bc of it. also why he would risk dating someone for months while internally thinking they might hate him when he tells them the truth. like why risk the possibility of wasting both of our time and feelings?? it just really seemed like he was hiding it, which didn‚Äôt sit right w me. Me being weirded out has nothing to do w his religion, but the fact that he was hiding a major part of his life for months. 

Anyways moving on from that, atp i was still smoking, he had asking me to not smoke as often, so i went from smoking abt 5 times a week to maybe once or twice. I noticed that he started to get rlly quiet and weird when i would smoke on facetime, or take one little hit b4 we would go to crowded places (i get overwhelmed rlly easily), but he still never said anything. After abt 3 months of dating, we are officially together atp, i mentioned that i had taken a walk to the creek in my neighborhood and smoked and read a book, and how nice it was that the weather was finally warm again. He went completely silent. I kept asking him what was wrong and he wouldn‚Äôt say. i finally asked him ‚Äúare u mad bc i smoked?‚Äù. To which he finally responded ‚Äúu said u wouldn‚Äôt smoke as much, so why does it seem like nothings changed?‚Äù. We got in a huge argument were he basically told me he actually doesn‚Äôt want me to smoke at all, and if i do he would break up w me. I felt totally blindsided by this, it wasn‚Äôt fair at all. He started dating me knowing i smoke and never said anything abt it until this conversation. I felt like he was trying to change me. I felt like he waited until he knew i was in love w him to drop this on me, it felt like he was using my feelings for him to manipulate me into doing what he said, into being his perfect girl or something. 

He insisted that none of this had to do w religion, that he j had expectations in a relationship, and if i wanted to be w him, i needed to fit that. But by this point i had already changed the way i dressed, he wanted me to show less skin bc ‚Äúi‚Äôm his gf so other ppl shouldn‚Äôt get to see me like that‚Äù‚Ä¶so i started showing less skin and wearing outfits that i felt horrible in, there was no personality in my clothes anymore. I stopped smoking completely to make him happy. Even though my mental health was terrible, i was overthinking everything and having anxiety attacks often. And honestly even though it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have to do w religion‚Äù sometimes i felt like it would be sm easier for him to j be w a muslim girl, who would already agree w him on these things instead of him asking her to change for him. 

Then we get to the drinking thing, it was my best friends bday and we were going to shop and have lunch together. He asked me if i was going to drink and i said ‚Äúi might get one drink w lunch, j to celebrate w her‚Äù. He freaked out on me again, saying that he doesn‚Äôt wanna date someone who drinks, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not a religious thing, and that he j wants the best for me and my health. So i asked like ‚Äúdo u j not want me to drink for the rest of my life? what abt in the future?‚Äù and yeah he fully expected me to never have a drop of alcohol again in my life if i wanted to be w him. 
It‚Äôs just so aggravating bc even though my life doesn‚Äôt revolve around drinking and smoking, i don‚Äôt feel like i should have to limit myself j to be w someone who claims to love me. Especially when ive never and will never use substances irresponsibly.

It‚Äôs me and my twins 21st this year and she wants to go to New Orleans to a jazz bar, j to listen to music and grab a drink. My sister is VERY anti alcohol and smoking. She‚Äôs never done anything like that in her life. But she said she‚Äôd like to get ONE drink w me, to celebrate our 21st. And what i find insane is that my sister who will probably never drink again wants me to get one drink w her and i can‚Äôt with out getting broken up w. 

Idk it all just feels so unfair, we live together and have s3x regularly, which is definitely Haram, and he doesn‚Äôt expect me to convert, but i‚Äôm not allowed to drink or smoke? 
Should i try to talk to him again? Should i keep limiting my life to be w him or should i end things? 
I want him to be my husband and the father of my children, i couldn‚Äôt describe our entire relationship on here but he‚Äôs an amazing man who genuinely loves me and wants the best for me. i love him so so much and don‚Äôt want things to end, i j don‚Äôt know what to do.

1jgowkp,minzwashere,2025-03-21 19:13:31,653,"You get an unlimited drink cup, but you can only ever drink from that cup. You get a cup or standard-size drinking container of your choosing. Think a normal-size water bottle or whatever. 

This bottle will always be filled with the drink of your choosing. If you feel like drinking cold Sprite, the bottle will be filled with cold Sprite. If you decide you want hot coffee, the bottle will be filled with hot coffee, etc. 

These drinks are free and you will never run out. Whatever drink you want, at any time you want.

However, you can never drink from any other cup, bottle, or container ever again. If you go out to a restaurant, you must drink from your chosen bottle/cup. The same goes if you are at someone's house or whatever.

Other rules are as follows:

* The bottle is only for things you can drink, and it's only for you. Other people can know about the bottle, but you cannot wish for liquid gold or something and try to sell it. If anyone else tries to drink from the bottle, it will be empty.

* You cannot move the liquid outside of the bottle except into your mouth. However, this does mean you can never spill water (or whatever liquid) on yourself.

* You are still able to eat foods and things like soup normally. Just not beverages

* The one exception to this is medication. If that medication is not available in pill form, then you may take it in liquid form in another drinking container. 
* You can still drink water from a faucet, shower, etc. but you can't use a cup or something.

* You are allowed to change/replace the designated drinking container once every 12 months. Once you change the container, you must keep that one for the next 12 months.

* During your lifetime, you are allowed a maximum of 5 extra replacements in case of loss, damage, etc. Using a replacement does not reset the 12-month countdown, so if you lose the bottle, you can't just get a temporary container and then buy a new one. You'd have to use that container for the next 12 months. For example, if you lose the bottle and there is only a paper cup available, then you are stuck using a paper cup for the next 12 months.

* Once you accept or decline the deal, your decision is final.

Great way of condensing the show with your favorite moments from the anime. Everyone was dressed up (I dressed as Sakura) and you were encouraged to get hyped vocally when your favorite character was on screen. The roar for Jiraiya was pretty special to witness with the crowd. Hopefully they do a part two with Shippuden. :)

1jgmtyr,Armadillo_Then,2025-03-21 17:46:40,834,"Am I Wrong for refusing to cut my son‚Äôs hair for my BIL‚Äôs wedding? I honestly feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. My 26F and my husband 28M have been going back and forth with my BIL (M29) and his fianc√© (29F). 
Recently, my BIL, will call him Mike, proposed to his girlfriend, Lacey. Mike asked my husband to be his best man, which he accepted. He also asked if my son, who is one year old, to be one of their ring bearers. My husband and I discussed and agreed to him being the ring bearer. Everything was fine until a few weeks ago. Mike called my husband and asked him if we would be getting my son‚Äôs hair cut for their wedding, which is this August. My husband said no, as his hair is not unruly and we are waiting to get his first hair cut. His hair is curly, and covers his forehead, but it isn‚Äôt excessively long and we keep it clean and brushed, if that matters.  Mike hung up and we thought that was the end of it. We even laughed at the silliness of the request. 
One week later, Mike calls again and says that Lacey is insisting that we get his haircut. Again, their wedding is over 4 months away. We again said no, that we were going to wait until my son gets older. We said that unless it starts to bother my son or it gets hard to manage, we were not going to get it cut. We assured him that it would be clean and look good if they were worried about the pictures. Mike got upset and I asked if I could call Lacey to talk through any concerns she may have with the hair. He got even more upset and said that I had to ask him before I talked with Lacey about anything. Then they (he and Lacey) would discuss if it was OK for me to talk to her or not. I was flabbergasted at this comment, why would I need to ask permission to talk to my soon-to-be SIL, and why is my son‚Äôs hair such a big deal??

For some necessary background, I don‚Äôt dislike Lacey. She is very naive and I feel as though Mike pushes her around and blames things on her. She goes along with it because she wants to be married. When they were visiting for a few days a few months before he proposed, I asked if Mike was her first boyfriend, which he was, and I told her that I was always there if she ever wanted to talk or had any questions. I know that I am younger, but I have, unfortunately, a lot more experience with relationships and have been married for 3 years. She was very appreciative and thanked me. After that, though, Mike got upset and said I needed to tell him what I was going to talk to her about before I talked to her. He also didn‚Äôt like that he wasn‚Äôt around when I talked to her. 

I guess I just need advice on if it is reasonable for them to ask us to cut our son‚Äôs hair for their wedding? I have no idea if Lacey is asking to cut my son‚Äôs hair, or if Mike is. I also have no idea if Lacey is even aware that Mike asked this. Also, should I do anything about the whole situation about needing permission to talk to Lacey? My husband is completely on my side and is willing to pull my son out of the wedding and himself if that is what I want to do. I don‚Äôt want to create drama, but I am honestly shocked at this. My MIL, who has always been very reasonable and welcoming to me, doesn‚Äôt want to get in the middle because she is afraid if she does that Mike will not come to see her. 

Any advice or thoughts is helpful. My husband and I have already tried talking to Mike about concerns before he proposed, but nothing has come from it. Mike lives 2.5 hours away so it is not like we can just go there. ",/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1jgmtyr/am_i_wrong_for_refusing_to_cut_my_sons_hair_for/

Giving kids ""unique"" names is not  as fun for the person who has to explain the pronunciation, spelling, and origin of the name every single time it comes up on a roster or meeting.

They were very kind but also honest. I just can‚Äôt hack it. For a few months I thought my struggles in the ED were just bc I had a terrible, borderline abusive preceptor. I did, and she was dealt with and I got a new one. But I still didn‚Äôt really progress. When it got to 5 patients, 2 of them critical, 2 of them brand new EMS‚Äôs with no techs or extra nurses to help, I just got completely lost time after time. I was hours behind on meds and tasks, forgot things the second I walked away from the computer, made critical mistakes, didn‚Äôt ask questions bc I was so lost I didn‚Äôt even know what to ask. I was desperately searching for some type of system to help me stay on track but nothing I tried worked. 

My manager and preceptor were very clear that I do have strengths and they think I will be an excellent nurse, just not in this ED. They did say in the future, after I‚Äôve developed a stronger nursing foundation, it‚Äôs possible I could return to an ED. It does kinda sting bc I guess emergency medicine was part of my identity. I did prehospital emergency jobs for a decade before this and I was successful. I got awards as an Army combat medic and became an NCO quickly. I taught NREMT classes at local colleges and abroad. I LOVE emergency medicine, especially trauma. But I learned the hard way that prehospital is VERY different than in-hospital, and it‚Äôs possible to be good at one but not the other. At the end of the day, how I see myself and what I want do not take priority over patient safety. And I agree with my management that I cannot be a safe nurse in this ED right now. 

They are helping me transfer to another dept but the only ones taking new grads in my hospital are med surg. I have an interview next week with the trauma MS floor. I wanted to stay in critical care, and manager+preceptor said I would probably do amazing in PACU. They haven‚Äôt heard back from them yet tho. I‚Äôm ready to take the L and be open to a new experience that I previously did not want (med surg lol).  

Guess I‚Äôm just sharing my sad new grad story. Maybe it helps someone else feel less alone in their perceived failures. We‚Äôll see what comes next, I guess. ",/r/nursing/comments/1jgpxq2/welp_fired_from_ed/

Excerpt:

‚ÄúThat gradual decline in well-being in the United States is, if you start digging into it, especially driven by people that are below 30,‚Äù Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, professor of economics at the University of Oxford, leader of the Wellbeing Research Centre and editor of the World Happiness Report, tells Fortune. ‚ÄúLife satisfaction of young people in the U.S. has declined.‚Äù

If you were only to assess those below 30, the U.S. wouldn‚Äôt even rank in the top 60 happiest countries, the report finds. It‚Äôs the same reason for the U.S.‚Äôs dramatic drop last year from no.15 to no.23. But the continuous decline is concerning, researchers note. 

‚ÄúIt is really disheartening to see this, and it links perfectly with the fact that it‚Äôs the well-being of youth in America that‚Äôs off a cliff, which is driving the drop in the rankings to a large extent,‚Äù De Neve says.

Years go by I‚Äôm 13 and more confident, and I can‚Äôt even remember what he did but I schemed for a good couple of days. 

I went through the entire house top-to-bottom and found every lighter and match and chucked them over the fence. 

(He kept his lighters in our sunroom when he was home, so I knew he had none on him.)

He was such a heavy chain smoker, and I successfully enraged him. Seeing him sprint around the house with the cigarette and no way to light it was a highlight in my young life I will never forget.

Woman stressed me the fuck out for several playthroughs because she is an absolute glutton for damage. I did my damndest in every fight she is in to keep her from dying. Because, y'know, non-companions can't be revived. So every time she died, I would reload the fight.

Then I finally got to the end of act 3, during the huge battle before reaching the netherbrain. I called Alyin into the fight, obviously, and send her down to deal with some winged horrors.

1jgp6yj,imthebet,2025-03-21 19:25:49,542,"SURVEY RESULTS! Significant constituent dissatisfaction with Congressman Kiley's CA District 3 representation Key Takeaway - significant constituent dissatisfaction with Congressman Kiley's representation.

Tahoe and California-focused issues:

It's clear that one of the biggest gaps between constituent priorities and Kevin Kiley's performance in addressing their priorities lies in forest service staff and budget cuts. 

Constituents consider discontinuing high speed rail efforts lower priority than other issues, and the majority of constituents gave Kiley a poor performance rating for his handling of this issue.  This suggests that Kiley should prioritize issues that are more important to his constituents.

Constituents were more likely to feel ""unsure"" about the importance of issues like dismantling of the Coastal Commission and  discontinuing high speed rail efforts, as well as Kiley's handling of these issues.  This suggests a need to better educate the community on these issues and Kiley's handling of them.

National issues:

Across the board, there was a clear gap between constituents' priorities (majority selected high priority for every issue) and Kevin Kiley's handling of each issue (majority ranking poor).



Poll question - In addition to the issues listed above, what other issues would you like to see Congressman Kiley focus on? (raw responses)

Speak out against DOGE dismantling our governmental services. If they want to find fraud waste, and abuse, they would be using forensic accountants, not newbie coders with an agenda.

His constitutional responsibilities as a congressman.

Free speech, law and order (doge is illegal and inefficient, the firings are unlawful terminations, costs of the dismantling will be ten times the ‚Äòsavings‚Äô, communities will collapse at home and abroad), the constitution,‚Ä¶Russia is the aggressor, us national security is at risk as no one will share info anymore‚Ä¶

Protecting our immigrant neighbors.

Free speech, law and order (doge is illegal and inefficient, the firings are unlawful terminations, costs of the dismantling will be ten times the ‚Äòsavings‚Äô, communities will collapse at home and abroad), the constitution,‚Ä¶Russia is the aggressor, us national security is at risk as no one will share info anymore‚Ä¶

Holding the politicians that are breaking the law accountable.

We are watching with horror while Trump and Musk dismantle our government, gut the forest service, and take away funds from our schools and universities

Take people off the streets in our name and disappear them to El Salvador with no due process

Watch Trump is giving up our place of leadership in the world

I want to know - what is your red line? Is there any line this lawless felon will cross that is too much for you. Stand up for us and stand up for the rule of law.

SAVE ActUSAID, outrageous conflicts of interest by Trump and Musk.Maintain good foreign relations with democratic neighboring countries and our pre-Trump allies. Stop supporting displacement/genocide and indiscriminate bombing in Gaza.

1jgluup,beanfiddler,2025-03-21 17:07:20,823,"Everyone respects me more as a litigator when I finally broke the habit of dressing like a basic bitch I have to share this, because I got the worst advice **ever** at the career center in law school, and it has taken *years* to undo the impact it has had on perceptions of my effectiveness as a litigator.

If you're a female attorney, *stop dressing like a basic bitch if you don't like dressing like a basic bitch*.

From high school on, I had a fairly distinct personal style somewhere between rockabilly and moody librarian. I preferred darker colors, long nails in non-neutral colors, winged eyeliner, black plastic frames, old fashioned silhouettes, dresses, chunky heels, and wearing my dark hair long and curly.

Before OCI my 1L year, the career center took aside the top ranked students, and ripped apart our resumes and interview skills. I was assigned to work with a woman that was conventionally attractive, very thin, tall, and very Anglo and blonde. I was told my personal style was ""unapproachable"" and clashed with ""firm culture"" at many of the top firms in town.

So I made the biggest mistake: I changed my personal style drastically. I bought neutral colored pant suits and shirts, softened my makeup, cut my nails and painted them pink, started wearing contacts, and completely changed my hair, adding highlights, cutting it to just below my chin, straightening it, and cutting *bangs*. I also stopped wearing clothes at my natural waist than emphasized that I was curvy, and switched all my ornate silver jewelry for tiny modern gold posts. Of course, changing my silhouette so drastically wasn't exactly flattering: I'm quite short and I have a huge bum and big chest, so I just looked like a fat little square. Also the highlights washed me out and looked silly with my complexion.

Needless to say, I think everyone at OCI could pick up that I was uncomfortable in my presentation, and I didn't get very many call backs in 1L year, despite being one of the top ranked students. I gather this made some of my friends, that knew I was ranked much higher than them, super weirded out when they got call backs at big firms that had blown me off entirely. I don't resent them for it, it's not their fault that those big firms had issues with dumpy little shorties like me.

Since graduating, I've slowly returned to dressing how I want to. My skirts returned to A-line, my blouses became lacy again, my glasses came back, I wear witchy platform boots sometimes, and the winged eyeliner is my every day staple. I don't even have pants for work anymore, all of my suits are skirt suits or a blazer over a dress. I put my stud back in my nose and started wearing several silver rings again.

This has proven polarizing, but the people that like it? *Really like it.* Sure, the haters are still there, but they didn't like me when I was a dumpy little weirdo trying to hide my fupa in a hideous beige pantsuit, so it's no great loss. At least this way, I get all sorts of compliments from judges, other lawyers, and their staff on how much they love my block heels, my nails, and that one black and gray lace blazer that looks an old English smoking jacket, or the frilly bright red shirt that looks like a matador blouse.

Anyway, ladies? Dress professionally, but dress how you want. If you're hyper femme Barbie, buy that hot pink suit and stiletto white heels.

First of all his brightness was on full max so for the first three second I just experienced a flashbang, and when my eyes adjusted he just looked at me like he was giving a TED talk on advanced mathematics. I was expecting him to show me something disgusting but for whatever reason he had his FM save open

I had to look beyond the grease and crumbs on the screen and keyboard (and a small white stain I REALLY do not want to think about), but what I could tell he was showing me his formation of his Celtic team. Now I play some FM, and whatever monstrosity he had on screen I could not comprehend was even possible in the game. Every single player of his was full on attack like they were Japanese Kamikaze pilots, and half the team seemed out of position

He did some stuff with the defensive line and gave me a look of superiour smugness mixed with sadness, like he is some tactical mastermind that is struggling to make his intellect understood. Idk maybe he thought I'd see his tactics, swoon over his masterplan and be like, ‚ÄúOh my god, a mid-block with inverted wing-backs? Celtic in the CL final?? Take me right here and now'. I just felt weirded out, not even by him randomly showing me his FM save but moreso by the way he did it. I gave him a look of confusion and I just got off at the next stop so I could save myself the embarrasment, was worth waiting half an hour for the next bus honestly.

That‚Äôs why employees at the store Smitten Kitten were able to notice a woman slumped over in her parked car outside the shop. ‚Å†  
‚Å†  
A staff member went to the owner, Jennifer ‚ÄúJP‚Äù Pritchett. They knocked on the window and yelled but the woman didn‚Äôt respond. Pritchett opened the driver‚Äôs unlocked door and saw the woman was not breathing.‚Å†  
‚Å†  
Thinking the woman seemed to be overdosing, Pritchett leaped into action and yelled back in the store for employees to grab their stash of Narcan, a brand name of naloxone, the drug that reverses an opioid overdose.‚Å†  
‚Å†  
After receiving seven doses of Naloxone via nasal spray and injection, Pritchett said the woman vomited, came to and started talking. ‚Å†  
‚Å†  
‚ÄúEMS thanked us for responding, and said they were surprised we had so many doses available, and it‚Äôs just because we care about our neighborhood and our neighbors and wanted to be prepared for something like this to happen. I‚Äôm glad that we were, I‚Äôm very grateful,‚Äù Pritchett said.‚Å†

Their deaths were preventable and others died alongside them and because of this a lawsuit followed and at a young age my husband found himself orphaned but wealthy. But I think we can all understand that this money wasn't some great thing that he celebrated because it came at a huge loss for him; his parents.

We met a few years after he was awarded the money and we got married after dating for four years. We're now the proud parents to our three kids and we have a stable life. We're very comfortable and few know exactly how much my husband actually has. He's very smart with his money and not only invests but looks to our future and the future of each of our children. We both still work very hard but the money means we are also very fortunate.

My family (parents and sister) is aware that my husband's parents are dead. They also know about the lawsuit and that money was paid to the family members. They have no idea how much my husband has. Not my parents and definitely not my sister. But they know and were told how he'd give it all away to have his parents back.

Which is why I reacted strongly when my sister made the comment she did.

We had my family over for dinner. My sister mentioned wanting to bring her boyfriend for any future dinners and everyone was talking about that. Then my sister mentioned wanting to go away with her boyfriend for the weekend and how they were saving up to go. She said it was a big step because they were also talking about moving in with each other. My husband mentioned we had gone to the place they were talking about going to and they'd have a great time. She said she hoped so but she wouldn't have the same kind of money he does. He told her we did nothing fancy there (which is 100% true). My parents wanted to know when they were thinking of moving in together. Things were going fine. Then my sister out of nowhere said to my husband the least he could do was offer them the money for the weekend away since he could afford it. I shut her down and said she wasn't entitled to other people paying for her trips with her boyfriend. My sister responded that he could afford to send them for a month if he wanted to. My husband told her that was a big ask and she snapped at him and said he had no idea how lucky he was to be rich because she'd give anything to have that kind of money.

The insensitivity of the comment enraged me and I told my sister she needed to leave. I made sure to get her ass out that door too because I wasn't tolerating that BS. My sister has told me almost every day since that I overreacted and throwing her out was OTT. I told her I don't want to hear anything but a sincere apology from her to my husband and until that point she can stay out of my house.

My husband said I didn't need to stand by that and he didn't want to come between us. I told him he wasn't coming between us. She was. AITA for my actions and am I being too harsh here? I just thinking that comment is downright cruel and vicious when you consider my husband had to be orphaned to get that money.",/r/AITAH/comments/1jgffck/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_of_my_house_for/

1jgmggr,AltruisticResponse78,2025-03-21 17:31:34,728,"Peak meme boys Yes, this is a real posters for films. Russians know them exactly by these names.

To be short, ""–±—Ä–∞—Ç–≤–∞"" was a popular slang words back then in 00s and 10s, bcs boys and male teenagers were in love with ""–≥–æ–ø-–∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–æ–π"".
The localization studios decided to name these films just purely because of that, lol.

Here is a full list of films names:
-–ü–æ–¥–≤–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –±—Ä–∞—Ç–≤–∞ (The Underwater gang) - Shark Tale - Actual name should be: –ê–∫—É–ª—å—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è.

-–õ–µ—Å–Ω–∞—è –±—Ä–∞—Ç–≤–∞ (The Forest gang) - Over the Hedge - Actual name should be: –ó–∞ –∏–∑–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—å—é

-–ë—Ä–∞—Ç–≤–∞ –∏–∑ –¥–∂—É–Ω–≥–ª–µ–π (The gang from Jungles) - Delhi Safari - Actual name should be: –°–∞—Ñ–∞—Ä–∏ –≤ –î–µ–ª–∏

- –ê–ª—å—Ñ–∞ –∏ –û–º–µ–≥–∞: –ö–ª—ã–∫–∞—Å—Ç–∞—è –±—Ä–∞—Ç–≤–∞ (Alpha and Omega: The fang gang) - Alpha and Omega - Actual name should be: to be honest they were close, it should be just –ê–ª—å—Ñ–∞ –∏ –û–º–µ–≥–∞

- –ö–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –±—Ä–∞—Ç–≤–∞ (The space gang) - Gadgetgang in Outer Space - Actual name should be: –ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –≤ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–æ–º –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–µ


My opinion: as a Russian, its OKAY~ names, not GOOD~, but the last one could be terrible with actual name.

Hope you were interesting, thank you.",/r/russian/comments/1jgmggr/peak_meme_boys/

sorry for bad wording, I‚Äôm really really really sad.

I fell in love with the limited Kaweco Iridescent Pearl and was lucky a local online store was selling one. Since I‚Äôm a student of a country with weak currency, I took 3 weeks before ordering this pen, it was 27% of my budget. I decided to gift it to myself since I scored the highest in 4 of my midterm exams.

On monday, I went home after school excited to unbox and use my pen for the very first time. I was really happy because I had a genuine connection with the pen, a feeling that it was made for me. I was really excited to bring it to school and see the colors pop out with the sunlight in our classroom but unfortunately I got sick for 2 days. On thursday, I recovered just enough to be able to attend classes, and I admired my pen the entire day.

I was supposed to write an entry for my journal last night when I realized that it was missing. My head was aching the entire day on thursday so I must have forgotten to put it back to my case or it must have fallen out of my pocket when I was hurriedly getting home. I looked everywhere, it really was nowhere to be found.

I cant believe I lost my pen in such a small amount of time. I wasn‚Äôt even able to use it much because I was bedridden (tho it slept beside me). I‚Äôm honestly so distraught, I hate myself for beinf so careless. It‚Äôs still in stock in the shop but I dont know if I can trust myself to have another one. I guess I‚Äôll just love my pen from afar, wherever it is.",/r/fountainpens/comments/1jglwou/i_loved_you_for_4_days/
